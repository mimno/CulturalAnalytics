Rationale
Background
Analysis of narrative structure can be said to answer the question “Who tells what,
and how?”.1 The first part of the question thus concerns aspects such as who is
narrating, whether it is a character in the story or not, and if it is a first-person
or third-person narrator. The second part is related to the story and its basic
elements: characters and events, and how the sequence of events forms a plot.
The third part concerns how the narrative text is constructed: ordering of the
events, the perspective from which the story is seen, how much information the
narrator has access to, etc.
The key part of our annotation scheme is related to the “who?”, in other words,
keeping track of who is doing the telling (showing, speaking), and to whom. To
this end, our annotation scheme is grounded in the basic levels of narrative transmission: author-reader (highest level), narrator-narratee (intermediate level) and

narrative, http://www.uni-koeln.de/˜ame02/pppn (accessed September 30, 2018). Compare also the
classification of “narration” (which is about the “who?”), “story” (“what?”) and “text” (“how”?) in

character-character (lowest level).2 Typically, works of literary fiction consist of
alternations between the second and third of these levels: narration and fictional
dialogue. As for narration, we annotate voice, which corresponds to the narrator’s
relationship to the story, and specifically whether the narrator is ever present in
the story or not. The most detailed part of our annotation concerns the dialogue,
however, for which we keep track of turns, lines, speakers and addressees.
Our annotation of the “what?” is rather rudimentary. We have a notion of scene
which is meant to capture a coherent set of events and characters at a particular time and place, but no means of ordering sequences of scenes timewise or
causally, and hence no notion of plot. Also, only characters that take part in fictional dialogue become part of the annotation.
Our annotation of the “how?” is also relatively rudimentary. We annotate focalisation, that is, the perspective from which the narrative is seen and specifically
how much information the narrator has access to. Furthermore, we annotate narrative levels in the sense of stories within stories by using embeddings within the
intermediate level of narrative transmission.
Our emphasis of the “who?” no doubt reflects the fact that we have approached
the problem of narrative structure from linguistics. In particular, given the apparent resemblances between fictional dialogue and everyday conversation, it makes
sense to apply linguistic models in the analysis of the former.3 Suitable models
that have been mentioned in the literature include speech-act theory and Conversation Analysis, but computational methods for the study of dialogue may also
be useful. In contrast, the language of higher narrative-transmission levels can
only “create an illusion, an effect, a semblance of mimesis,” 4 which means that
the role of linguistic analysis is less straightforward.
In developing our annotation scheme, we have used the following criteria as guiding principles:
• Simplicity and readability. We have opted for a simple annotation scheme
whose result should be easy to read together with the original texts. To this
end, we use embedded (in-line) annotation in the original text.
• Hierarchical tagset. To increase inter-annotator agreement, we use a hierarchical tagset with mutually exclusive tag categories in the same layers.

• Minimal interpretation. Ideally, we would like an annotation which represents as objectively as possible the basic events, the characters involved and
the discourse levels through which the narrative is transmitted, without undue subjective interpretation. This is arguably the most difficult principle
to attain, however.
• Relation to linguistic annotation. We assume that a machine-learning
model for predicting narrative structure will be based on annotation of
both the narrative and linguistic structures of the text. The latter might
build on what is produced by a standard automatic linguistic-analysis
pipeline, involving, for example, sentence segmentation, tokenisation,
part-of-speech tagging, named-entity recognition, syntactic parsing and
co-reference resolution.5 In contrast to narrative annotation, we consider
linguistic annotation to be a means and not a goal in itself, and therefore
do not include discussion of this here.

Overview of annotation layers
Our tagset is hierarchically structured in four annotation layers, ordered by an
inclusion relation. The top layer encodes voice, using the tags <VOICE_1> and
<VOICE_3> that correspond to whether the narrator is present in the story or
not, respectively. These are the opening tags; the corresponding closing tags are
written with a slash, </VOICE_1> and </VOICE_3> (and similarly for other tags
throughout). The second layer encodes focalisation, that is, the perspective from
which the narrative is seen and how much information the narrator has access to.
It includes the tags <FOC_UNR>, <FOC_INT> and <FOC_EXT>, corresponding to unrestricted, internal and external focalisation, respectively. The fact that
the annotation of focalisation is included in that of voice means that a change
of voice requires resetting focalisation, even though the value of the focalisation
may not change.
A focalisation includes one or more scenes in the third layer, <SCENE>, each
of which is a coherent set of events at a particular interval in time and place,
with a more or less constant set of characters. A scene typically consists of alternations between narration and dialogue, annotated using <NARRATOR> and
<CHARACTERS>, but may also contain <AUTHOR>. In addition, these types
of discourses may be embedded in each other (to be detailed below).

A characters’ discourse, <CHARACTERS>, consists of one or more turns, each
of which is associated with one speaker (or a chorus of several speakers) and
one or more addressees (who may vary). Thus, whereas the speaker (or set of
speakers) is immutable throughout a turn, this does not necessarily hold for the
addressee(s). Finally, each turn consists of one or more lines, each of which is
associated with one speaker (or a chorus of several speakers) and one addressee
(or a set of addressees). In addition, a line consists of one or more utterances,
that is, sentences or fragments typically distinguished by full stops in the text.
Utterances are not part of the annotation, however. Note that only lines are tagged
with speaker(s) and addressee(s), and that there is no notion of opening or closing
tags in this case. Note also that we make a difference between addressees and
listeners: addressees are the recipients of lines, whereas listeners overhear lines
without being recipients. We only annotate addressees. In sum, a characters’
discourse is a sequence of turns uninterrupted by narrator’s discourses (unless
they are embedded). A description of the layers and discourse levels is shown in
Table 1.

Table 1. Hierarchical structure of the annotation scheme.

We use a deliberately simple criterion for delimiting the scope of a narrator’s
discourse, namely, letting each paragraph that begins with narration correspond
to one narrator’s discourse by enclosing it with opening and closing tags
(<NARRATOR> and </NARRATOR>). As for dialogue, each turn is often put
in a paragraph of its own in fictional works. But when we have a sequence of
turns, whether each line is in a paragraph of its own or not, we let the entire
sequence be enclosed by the corresponding opening and closing tags, that is,
<CHARACTERS> and </CHARACTERS>.

Discourse levels
Introduction
We assume that a text in its entirety can be divided into occurrences of the following three discourse levels:6
• Highest level: Transmission from the author to a (typically) imagined, but
explicitly referred reader of the work (for an example, see Section Transmission across levels). We refer to this as author’s discourse.
• Intermediate level: Transmission from a narrator to a narratee. The latter
can be visible or invisible, but is distinct from (the imagined) reader of the
work. We refer to this as narrator’s discourse.
• Lowest level: Transmission between characters in the story in the form of
dialogue, whether direct or indirect discourse.7 We refer to this as characters’ discourse. The dialogue is typically spoken, but we also take soliloquy
and interior monologue to be possible types of characters’ discourse.8
Assuming that transmission between author and reader is the exception in fiction, a narrative typically consists of passages alternating between the two lower
levels.9
To annotate discourses in the three levels, we use opening and closing
tags indicating both the type of speaker and addressee at the respective
level, namely, <AUTHOR–READER>, <NARRATOR–NARRATEE> and
<CHARACTERS–CHARACTERS>. For convenience, and when there is no
ambiguity, we may abbreviate <NARRATOR–NARRATEE> as <NARRATOR>
and <CHARACTERS–CHARACTERS> as <CHARACTERS>. An example
text with alternating narrator’s and characters’ discourses is shown in Example
(1).10 (Note that this author uses neither dashes nor quotation marks, but only
paragraph breaks, to indicate turns.)

Characters’ discourses
Whereas narrator’s discourses capture narrations in the text, characters’ discourses corresponds to fictional dialogues between characters. A characters’
discourse consists of one or more turns, each of which consists of one or more
lines as defined above. A characters’ discourse is thus a sequence of turns
uninterrupted by narrator’s discourses.
To represent transmission between characters, we annotate each line with its
speaker and addressee, as in example (3).11 Specifically, we assume that a turn
has a single speaker, but that different lines within a turn may have different addressees. Also, a speaker may address more than one character simultaneously,
which means that one line can have several addressees. We only annotate the
intended recipient(s) of the utterance as addressees, whereas listeners who only
overhear a line are not annotated.

<Nick –Derek>
</TURN>
</CHARACTERS>
The first turn is divided into two lines since there is a change in addressees. The
second turn consists of one line which consists of two utterances.
Note that we do not have opening and closing tags that surround lines, but just
a speaker—addressee tag at the end of each line. The scope of the speaker—
addressee tag is the current line.
What we refer to as a line consists of a line proper, which is what is actually spoken
by the character, and optionally a speech-verb construction, which indicates who
the speaker (and possibly the addressee) is. Example (4) shows a line proper
with the direct speech of the officer, whereas Example (5) shows the speech-verb
construction that identifies the speaker.

“That was the first story,”

(5)

“said the officer,”

We have chosen to include the speech-verb construction in the line tag to avoid
cluttering the annotation, and because these constructions follow a predictable
pattern.
In the case where a line has multiple addressees and (some of) these are not identifiable, this is annotated using the keyword SEVERAL. This is shown in Example
(6):12

Embeddings
Characters’ discourse embedded in characters’ discourse
Discourse levels can be embedded into each other. In particular, when a character is quoting or recounting a dialogue with someone else, this is represented by
embedding that characters’ discourse into the present one. This is annotated as
an additional opening of CHARACTERS inside the present characters’ discourse,
as in Example (9).15

Narrator’s discourse embedded in characters’ discourse
Elements of narrator’s discourse may be interspersed, typically in a fragmentary
way, inside lines in a characters’ discourse without breaking the flow of the dialogue. We represent this by an embedding of the narrator’s discourse in the
present characters’ discourse.
Example (11) illustrates this, where the line “ ‘It tastes like liquorice,’ the girl said”
is followed by the narrator’s description, “and put the glass down”, which is thus
embedded within the characters’ discourse.17

Note that, in accordance with what was said at the end of the introduction section,
an embedding is a change of discourse level within another level. This means that
if a paragraph begins with dialogues and ends with a narration, the narration is
embedded in the character discourse.

Characters’ discourse embedded in narrator’s discourse
We represent indirect discourse - broadly speaking, dialogue rendered narratively
- by embedding a characters’ discourse into the present narrator’s discourse.18 Example (12) shows two subsequent characters’ discourses being embedded in one
narrator’s discourse, which is in turn followed by another characters’ discourse.19

In sum, by embedding the characters’ discourse in a narrator’s discourse, we represent the fact that it’s being rendered indirectly through the narration, and not
directly as in a (non-embedded) characters’ discourse appearing at the (top) level
of alternating narrator’s and characters’ discourses. The reason that we still represent this using an (embedded) characters’ discourse is that we want to capture
all transmission between the characters, whether it occurs directly at the lowest
discourse level or is rendered indirectly at the intermediate level.
Narrator’s discourse embedded in narrator’s discourse
A narrator’s discourse embedded in a narrator’s discourse corresponds to what
has been called narrative level, in other words, a story within a story.20 Example
(13) shows a story imagined by the character within the main story.21

An example of multiple embeddings
There may be multiple layers of discourse level embeddings. The following example illustrates this.23 In Example (15), the narrator’s discourse has an embedded
characters’ discourse, which in turn has an embedded narrator’s discourse.

Transmission across levels
Transmission typically occurs within a single discourse level, but it may also
cut across levels,24 a phenomenon referred to as metalepsis.25 For example,
the narrator may explicitly address the (supposed) reader. We annotate this
by including the addressee explicitly (here READER) in the discourse level tag
(<NARRATOR>) as in Example (16).

You are about to begin reading Italo Calvino’s new novel, If on a winter’s night a
traveler. Relax. Concentrate. Dispel every other thought. Let the world around
you fade. Best to close the door; the TV is always on in the next room. […]
</NARRATOR–READER>
We do not worry about the ontological status of an explicitly addressed reader,
for example, whether it is an implied reader or an identifiable physical person.
We distinguish this from the case when a narratee is addressed, typically using
second-person pronouns, but no explicit reference to a reader or an act of reading
is being made, as in Example (17).26
(17) <NARRATOR>
If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you’ll probably want to know is
where I was born, and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents
were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of
crap, but I don’t feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth. […]
</NARRATOR>
Here, it might be tempting to think of “you” as an imagined reader, but it might
just as well be an (imagined, third-person) listener to whom Holden Caulfield
is telling his story. In the absence of information linking “you” with a reader,
we assume the latter possibility. <NARRATOR> is thus the short form for
<NARRATOR–NARRATEE>.

Scenes
To represent the basic progression of events in a narrative, we use a notion of
scenes, inspired from film. We take a scene to be a coherent set of events at a
particular interval in time and place, with a more or less constant set of characters.
Furthermore, we take a scene to be the minimal unit in this respect, anticipating
that we will later be able to use scenes as primitives in higher-level structures,
such as plot. Consider Example (18) about the protagonist of a novel (Frances)
who is seeing her father.27

I walked through town with my hands in my jacket pockets. The sun
was setting and I wondered what would be on television. I could feel a headache
developing, like it was coming down from the sky directly into my brain. I tried
stamping my feet as loudly as I could to distract myself from bad thoughts, but
people gave me curious looks and I felt cowed. I knew that was weak of me. Bobbi
was never cowed by strangers.
My father lived in a little terraced house near the petrol station. I rang
the doorbell and put my hands back in my pockets. Nothing happened. I rang
again and then I tried the handle, which felt greasy. The door opened up and I
stepped in.
Dad? I said. Hello?
[…]
I’m off, I said.
You’re away, are you?
That bin needs taking out.
See you again, my father said.
Our basic criterion for dividing a narrative into scenes is to think about it in terms
of a faithful rendering as a film or a play. In the example above, we would obtain
three scenes: The first one includes Frances and her mother at her mother’s place
talking to each other, the second is Frances’s walking on her own to her father’s
place, and the third one includes Frances and her father’s meeting at her father’s
place (further developed in the story). We would thus annotate the passage above
as in Example (19).

After dinner I told my mother I would visit him. She kneaded my shoulder

and told me she thought it was a good idea. <Mother–Frances>
It’s a great idea, she said. <Mother–Frances>
Good woman. <Mother–Frances>

In this example, there are three scenes. The first scene covers the first
<NARRATOR> and <CHARACTERS> elements. The second scene covers
the second <NARRATOR> element, and the third scene covers the third
<NARRATOR> element and the second and third <CHARACTERS> elements.

Narrative situation
This section describes two notions related to the position and perspective of the
narrator. We refer collectively to these as narrative situation.28

Voice
The notion of voice concerns the narrator’s relationship to the story, and more
specifically whether the narrator is ever present in the story or not.29 If the narrator appears in the story at some point, we say that we have a homodiegetic narrative. Such narrators usually refer to themselves in the first person, but there are
exceptions to this, such as Caesar’s De Bello Gallico in which the narrator refers
to himself in the third person. In contrast, if the narrator is never present in the
story, we say that we have a heterodiegetic narrative. Such narrators usually refer
to themselves in the third person, but again there are exceptions.
We annotate this binary distinction using <VOICE_1> for a homodiegetic narrator and <VOICE_3> for a heterodiegetic narrator, with corresponding closing
tags </VOICE_1> and </VOICE_3>, respectively.

Focalisation
We take focalisation to correspond to the perspective from which the narrative is
seen, and specifically how much information the narrator has access to; alterna28 Inspired by Gérard Genette, Narrative Discourse: An Essay in Method (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1983), 188, but we do not use the term in the full meaning developed there.

tively, in what ways this information is restricted.30 We distinguish the following
types:
• Zero or unrestricted The story is narrated from a fully unrestricted or omniscient perspective. This often involves helicopter views of the story that
no single character would be capable of, but it could also involve taking
the perspectives or looking into the souls of the individual characters. The
narrator knows more than any of the characters, symbolised by Narrator
> Character.31 We annotate this as <FOC_UNR> with a corresponding
closing tag </FOC_UNR>.
• Internal The story is narrated from the inside perspective of a character
in the story, limited by the perception and feelings of that character. The
narrator knows only as much as this character, symbolised by Narrator =
Character.32 We annotate this as <FOC_INT> with a corresponding closing tag </FOC_INT>.
• External The story is narrated from a perspective outside of the characters
in the story, like using a camera, but without an omniscient perspective,
as in <FOC_UNR>. Typically, the main components of such narratives
are dialogues and narrations in the form of neutral descriptions of events.
The narrator knows less than any of the characters, symbolised by Narrator < Character.33 We annotate this as <FOC_EXT> with a corresponding
closing tag </FOC_EXT>.

Definitions
We end with a list of definitions of some of our central terminology.
Author’s discourse: The highest level of transmission in a narrative, from the
author to a (typically) imagined, but explicitly referred reader of a story. Consists
of text.

Characters’ discourse: The lowest level of transmission in a narrative, from character to character. Consists of one or more turns.
Dialogue: The text corresponding to a characters’ discourse. This is not limited
to spoken dialogue, but could also be soliloquy, interior monologue, thoughts,
etc.
Layer: This refers to the overall annotation, which is ordered by an inclusion
relation in four hierarchical layers.
Level: This refers to the type of narrative transmission in the fourth annotation
layer. We distinguish between the highest level (author’s discourse), the intermediate level (narrator’s discourse) and the lowest level (characters’ discourse).
Narration: The text corresponding to a narrator’s discourse.
Narrator: The teller of the narrative; the person who articulates (“speaks”) the
narrative.34
Narrator’s discourse: The intermediate level of transmission in a narrative, from
narrator to narratee. Consists of text.
Narrative: Anything that tells or presents a story.35
Narrative situation: A collective name for voice and focalisation.36
Story: A sequence of events involving characters.37
