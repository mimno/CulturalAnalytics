ABSTRACT
This article uses a quantitative approach to study the reception of women writers in post-war
Britain. Using data from two influential journals in the period (1946–1960), the TLS and the
Listener, we first establish a list of those contemporary British women writers who were most
frequently mentioned in these magazines. We then compare their representation in the magazines
to that of three comparison groups: a selection of British male contemporary writers, well-known
earlier British women writers, and canonical male authors. We explore how the differential
categories of gender and canonicity intersect in the (under-) representation of contemporary
women writers, and how this underrepresentation not only holds true for the mid-twentieth
century but, at least as it is reflected in the attention paid to writers by TLS reviewers, continues
in the later 20th and early 21st century

Introduction
This article presents a large-scale data analysis of the cultural presence of women
writers in post-war Britain.1 Its principal objective is to assess the cultural impact of
women authors in this period. Our approach measures this impact in relation to the
wider literary field, including a comparison with male contemporary authors,
canonical authors both male and female, and a selection from the subsequent
generation of women writers who emerge in the 1960s.
Feminist literary criticism has long paid attention to the representation of women in
fiction, to changing plot patterns or different types of female characters.2 But there

has not been much sustained research into the quantitative representation of women
writers in literary periodicals, or the press more generally, compared to their male
colleagues. Such research has only become possible in the last few decades due to
the availability of databases and new technologies of data mining, visualizing, and
modelling that enable “distant reading” or “reading by numbers.”3 These
technologies provide the tools to measure with some precision, based on empirical
data, the degree of underrepresentation and disadvantage of women authors in the
literary field.
As an earlier quantitative study of English-language fiction has shown, the
proportion of women writers producing novels was reduced by half between 1850
and 1950, a decline found not only in ‘high-culture’ books preserved in academic
libraries, but also in the number of bestsellers written by women (sharply falling
between 1930 and 1970).4 This has been explained by broad socio-cultural changes:
the rising acceptability for men of being a professional novelist and for women to
take up other professions, and the subsequent ‘edging out’ of women from the
literary marketplace.5 As Underwood et al. (2018) have demonstrated, women in this
period before the 1970s and the rise of second-wave feminism are not only
underrepresented as authors but also as characters in fiction, even in books written
by women.
For our more local study, we have chosen the immediate post-war period in Britain
up to 1960, a time that has been called the “nadir of British feminism”,6 mainly
because of a widespread return to traditional gender roles after World War II. In
English literature, more particularly, this period is known for its “angry young men”
in fiction and drama and the (mostly male) Movement in poetry. An ongoing process
of canon revision has helped to redress the balance by bolstering the reputations of
post-war British women writers such as Barbara Pym, Mary Renault, and Elizabeth
Taylor. Yet, so far, there has been little systematic research into contemporary
mechanisms of recognition and canon formation.7
Our study focuses on British literary life in the post-war period up to 1960, not in
terms of the quantity of publications but in looking at how often contemporary
women writers of the 1940s and 1950s are mentioned in reviews and other editorial
content in two leading literary and cultural magazines of the time, the Times Literary
82

Supplement (TLS) and the Listener. These journals offer a glimpse of how reviewers
(both male and female) saw (or constructed) the literary field of their own time, and
how they sized up and established literary reputations by invoking the names of
canonical authors as standards of comparison. We stop in 1960 before the advent of
the boom in fiction by a new generation of women writers such as Angela Carter,
Margaret Drabble, and A. S. Byatt.
Our results give an indication of how ‘masculine’ book reviewing was in Britain
from the mid-1940s to the late 1950s. We found that only few contemporary women
writers are mentioned with any frequency or regularity in these pages, compared to
a selection of their male contemporaries. Those women who are frequently
mentioned and can thus be regarded as the leading female authors of their time are
mentioned much less often than the men with whom they compete for the attention
of reviewers and the reading public.
The results of our study will not come as a surprise. We found that a dead male
author was far more likely to be mentioned by name than a living male author. Men
were more likely to be named than women, canonical or contemporary. As an
additional result, we now know who the dominant women writers were, in terms of
mentions by name, in the TLS and the Listener, two representative magazines with
different but overlapping target audiences – a venerable ‘highbrow’ institution and
a more ‘middlebrow’ publication. These results are also instructive for thinking
about literary generations; our ‘top twenty’ lists do not contain the authors one would
now associate with the post-war period (perhaps Muriel Spark or Iris Murdoch
would spring to mind) but authors who had established their reputation during the
interwar years: at the top are Rose Macaulay, born in 1881; Elizabeth Bowen, born
in 1899; and Edith Sitwell, born in 1887. The oldest writer in the lists below is the
actor and screenwriter Mabel Constanduros (1880); the only one born after 1920 is
the poet Elizabeth Jennings (1926).

Establishing the data
Embarking on this study, we first collected and documented as many women writers
from this period as possible. With the help of a small team, we were able to compile

83

P O S T - W A R B R I T I S H W O M E N W R I T E R S A N D T HE I R C U L T U R A L I M P A C T : A Q U A N T I T A T I V E A PP R O A C H

a list of women writers who were active in the period 1945–1960. The only criterion
for inclusion was whether they had been published in book form during this time;
we included British, but in a few cases also Anglo-Irish writers (Elizabeth Bowen)
or Americans who were active in Britain (Sylvia Plath). When in doubt, we favoured
inclusion to get the widest possible view of the literary field in Britain at this time.
We did not exclude any genre, so that ‘literary activity’ includes children’s books,
travel books, scholarly publications, etc. This was more difficult and laborious than
expected, and the work has not yet been fully concluded. It is probably impossible
to establish a complete list, but the preliminary dataset used for this article now
comprises 1100 women authors.8 These have been checked for pseudonyms and
other potential sources of confusion; quite a few women writers published under one
or more assumed names. In at least one case there are two writers ‘hiding’ behind
the same name, Hazel Adair. In establishing the data, the aim was to count persons,
not names, so there are two Hazel Adairs, but authors publishing under several
pseudonyms are counted as one. We are confident that the basis for this study is a
representative selection of British women writers active during this period.9
Next to sales figures, which are rather difficult to come by for this period, literary
prizes are an indicator of writers’ critical and popular presence. In a survey of sixteen
British literary awards between 1945 and 1960, totalling 191 prize-giving events, we
found that 49 were awarded to women and 142 to men; 25.6 % or just over a quarter
of the winners were women.10 A more detailed analysis of women’s literary
reputation and their impact on the culture at large is possible by examining
contemporary book reviews. For this purpose, two databases are particularly useful:
the TLS Historical Archive, which presents a searchable full-text database of the
Times Literary Supplement, the leading British literary journal, covering almost the
entire 20th century and the first decade of the 21st; and the Listener Historical
Archive, which presents a searchable full-text database of the BBC’s own magazine,
including regular book reviews, from 1929 to 1991. The thematic scope of the
Listener is obviously wider than that of the TLS, as will have been its readership,
with the advantage of giving a better sense of an author’s presence in the culture at
large, especially radio and television, as well as their popularity. We believe that the
combination of the TLS and the Listener data present a useful coverage of critical
reputation and popular appeal that may tell us more than awards and sales figures
alone. In order to be able to work with regular five-year spans, the temporal scope
84

J OURNAL OF CU LTURAL A NALYTICS

of the project was narrowed down to 1946–60, thus yielding three five-year spans
(1946–50, 1951–55, 1956–60).
While the set of women writers is as complete as currently possible, the comparison
groups are based on educated guesses. Relying on information from literary histories
and surveys of British literary life, we compiled three sample groups: twenty male
writers active in the same period (T. S. Eliot, Kingsley Amis, etc.), a sample of
earlier canonical women writers (Jane Austen, Virginia Woolf etc.), and a list of
male writers that form the traditional “core canon” or “hypercanon” of literature in
English (Shakespeare, Milton, Dickens etc.).11
The fact that two fifths of the women writers active in the period are never noticed
in the TLS, while less than a third of them are mentioned in the Listener, confirms
the general impression that many authors never receive any notice at all, even in
specialized journals. Considering that some categories of publications do not usually
receive reviews in the TLS, a review rate of 62 % of the total number of active
women writers is not at all a bad figure. However, what Franco Moretti memorably
called “the slaughterhouse of literature”12 really begins when we look at the relative
frequency with which those writers who do appear in the databases are mentioned,
in relation to other groups of writers.
For the TLS, the database allows us to include only editorial content (reviews,
editorials, poems etc.) and exclude advertising (mostly ads placed by publishers, but
also, e.g., the “School of Authorship” in Gloucester Place, London NW1, which
regularly advertised in the Notices section, offering courses by Enid Blyton, Pamela
Hansford Johnson, and other writers who are thus frequently mentioned, but occur
with considerably less frequency in the journal’s review section). Concerning the
Listener, where publishers’ ads are less frequent, we argued that a writer’s standing
in the wider culture is enhanced if and when he or she appears in such content, so
for this corpus we chose to include the complete text of the archive, while excluding
advertising content in the TLS archive. As the search functions of these databases do
not include gender as a category, it was not feasible to limit searches to texts written
by men or women, or to books under review by men or women. We counted the
frequency of names mentioned in these pages, not making a distinction between
authors as reviewers or authors whose books were being reviewed, or authors
mentioned in passing. We believe that these numbers, independent of the exact
85

P O S T - W A R B R I T I S H W O M E N W R I T E R S A N D T HE I R C U L T U R A L I M P A C T : A Q U A N T I T A T I V E A PP R O A C H

context in which they appear, reveal something about the authors’ relative standing
in the field, their cultural presence, prestige, or impact. Care was taken, in mining
the data, to account for pseudonyms and other potential contaminations – such as
mistaking the writer Elizabeth Taylor for the film star of the same name, or confusing
the writer Heather Cornish with an article about Cornish heather.
Literature is not a race, and authors are not racehorses who compete against each
other. But racehorses have been named after famous authors, and these had to be
excluded as well. Possibly, in the future, machine learning and artificial intelligence
will be smart enough to tell authors from horses. For this study, we still counted and
checked each reference manually. Quite a few errors will have passed us by, but we
are confident that we have established a reliable empirical basis, as reflected in the
Listener and TLS data, for a quantitative gender-critical study of the literary field of
post-war Britain.

The top twenty and their peers, 1946–60
In the Listener, 329 contemporary British women writers are mentioned 1758 times
over the period from 1946 to 1960. Statistically, every author could thus be named
five times, but this is of course not to be expected. The top twenty most frequently
mentioned writers occur 684 times, which means that only 6.1 % of the women
included in this sample receive 38.9 % of the mentions in this group, and only 1.8 %
of the women writers included in our total list of 1100. The top five receive almost
half of all mentions among the top group (46.2 %) and almost a fifth of the total
(18 %).
In the TLS, the overall distribution is less extreme. The total number of mentions is
4797. Out of 682 women writers mentioned, the top twenty are mentioned 886 times,
meaning that 2.9 % of the women in this sample receive almost a fifth (18.5 %) of
the mentions (of contemporary women writers). With 343 mentions, the top five
receive 38.7 % of the top twenty, or 7.2 % of the total mentions.
Table 1 presents an overview of the top twenty in both journals for the period under
discussion, with the number of times their name appears in each.

Table 1. Top twenty post-war British women writers in the Listener and the TLS 1946–60.

There are several striking aspects to note about these two top twenty lists. First of
all, only ten names feature in both lists. But there appears to be unanimous agreement
about the top: Bowen, Macaulay, Raine, and Sitwell are in the top five of both lists,
if in different positions.14 In terms of genres, the lists present a mixture of
(predominantly) novelists but also a number of poets (Bellerby, Jennings, Raine,
Sitwell), writers of detective fiction (Christie, Sayers), children’s books (Farjeon,
Streatfeild), biographies (Lane) and other nonfiction (Hawkes, Powell, Stark). For
modern readers, the lists might be even more interesting for the authors they do not

contain: Iris Murdoch, for example, is mentioned a mere 15 times in the Listener and
17 times in the TLS; Muriel Spark is mentioned a mere 14 times in the Listener. One
might be surprised to see a critically appreciated novelist like Ivy Compton-Burnett
languishing at a mere 22 mentions in the Listener and 24 in the TLS.

(37).
Next, we want to find out how these women writers perform in relation to their male
colleagues during the same period. For the latter, there is no complete or even near-

J OURNAL OF CU LTURAL A NALYTICS

complete list. In the absence of a gender-sensitive search function that would allow
us to find all the men or all the women mentioned in the corpus, one can in this case
only work with a set of educated guesses. Relying on frequently mentioned names
in literary histories and scholarly work on the period and its literary life, we
assembled a comparison group of twenty male post-war British writers. In doing so,
we aimed for a mixture of highly canonical figures like T. S. Eliot, Evelyn Waugh,
Kingsley Amis, and George Orwell with now less well-known but at the time quite
successful writers like Norman Collins and P. H. Newby, as well as the poet Philip
Larkin, the dramatist John Osborne, and the non-fiction writer Paul Brickhill, author
of the bestseller The Dam Busters, 1951, which became the first million-selling
British paperback in 1956.15
While these are not exactly the top twenty male authors as compared to the top
twenty women writers, one might expect the sample group to perform less well,
overall, than the women’s top twenty. However, this is not the case. Let us look at
the number of mentions for this group in both journals in this period:

Table 3. Male comparison group in Listener and TLS 1946–60.

Since this list of names is eclectic and not representative, we refrain from calculating
a combined ranking out of both journals. The relative strength of Anthony Powell in
the TLS list can be explained by the fact that he was a regular reviewer at this time.
In the Listener, this group of twenty men is mentioned a total of 1395 times during
this period (compared to 684 mentions of the women’s top twenty). It is probable
that there are other male authors not on our list who are mentioned quite frequently.
And yet we find that our artificial sample of male contemporaries is mentioned twice
as often as the top twenty women writers, by a margin of 44.2 % (67.1 % men vs.
32.9 % women).
In the TLS, we find these men mentioned 2150 times, compared to 886 times for the
top twenty women. Here the gender imbalance is almost as strong, with the men
dominating by a safe margin of 41.6 % (70.8 % men vs. 29.2 % women). Even if we
leave out the number one in both lists (in the TLS and the Listener, T. S. Eliot alone
commands around a quarter or a third of the mentions within this group, clear
evidence of his cultural significance during the period16), the remaining 19 men still
have a significant edge over their strongest female competitors:
Listener:

1084 vs. 684, or 61.3 % vs. 38.7 %.
1353 vs. 886, or 60.4 % vs. 39.6 %.

Margin: 22.6 %
Margin: 20.8 %

A further comparison group are earlier canonical women writers. We compiled a list
of twenty writers, all of them obvious candidates for inclusion. The frequencies of
these twelve writers in the corpus are as follows:

Table 4. Female canon comparison group, 1946–60.

The ranking is extremely similar in both journals, with only slight variations. Such
stability in the “core canon” of English literature across time is only to be expected.
One would be hard put to find more canonical women writers with a significant
number of mentions in the corpus; Margaret Cavendish and Mary Braddon, for
example, are mentioned only once in the TLS during this time, and Katharine Philips
never.
If we compare the frequency (number of mentions) in the Listener of the top twenty
British women writers 1946–60 (henceforth abbreviated as: ♀︎) with the frequency of
the top twenty in the comparison groups (canonical women writers, ♀︎C;
contemporary British male writers, ♂︎), we get the following results:

91

P O S T - W A R B R I T I S H W O M E N W R I T E R S A N D T HE I R C U L T U R A L I M P A C T : A Q U A N T I T A T I V E A PP R O A C H

Top 20 ♀︎: 684
Top 20 ♀︎C: 688
Top 20 ♂︎: 1395
In the Listener, in a sample of sixty writers comprising 2767 mentions, the twenty
British women writers (24.7 %) and the canonical women writers (24.9 %) each
make up slightly less than a quarter, while the contemporary British male writers
(50.4 %) reach an astonishing half. In this constellation, the contemporary men still
accomplish to outweigh the dead and living women writers by a margin of 0.8 %.
Now we add another comparison group: the traditional male canon (♂︎C), or at least
a selection of writers that are most likely to be prominent in this group. When we do
this, we see – again, something to be expected – this core canon outshining all other
groups. In the Listener, Shakespeare alone receives 1271 mentions between 1946
and 1960, Dickens 568, etc.18 The top twenty are as follows, with a total count of
5368 in the Listener and 9322 in the TLS:

♀︎ = contemporary women; ♀︎C = female canon; ♂︎ = contemporary men; ♂︎C = male canon.

The total number of mentions in this selection is 8135. Women writers together (♀︎+
♀︎C) comprise 1372 mentions, the men together (♂︎+ ♂︎C) 6763. The resulting ratio is
16.9 % women vs. 83.1 % men.
Whereas in The Listener, contemporary men outflank the canonical and
contemporary women writers (by a narrow margin of 0.8 %), in the TLS they do so
by a more impressive margin of 5 %. Bringing in the all-time male canon, the overall
picture becomes even clearer:

93

P O S T - W A R B R I T I S H W O M E N W R I T E R S A N D T HE I R C U L T U R A L I M P A C T : A Q U A N T I T A T I V E A PP R O A C H

Out of a total of 13,420 mentions, contemporary British women writers comprise a
share of merely 6.6 %; canonical women writers have 7.9 %. The sample of
contemporary British male writers make up 16 %, and the traditional male canon
69.5 %. In both journals, once the traditional male canon is brought into play, the
gender balance shifts dramatically. While the gender balance among the top authors
mentioned was already quite unequal in the Listener (16.9 % to 83.1 %, a gap of
66.2 percentage points), this gap is even wider in the TLS, where all women authors
in the top groups together comprise merely 14.5 % of the sample, compared to
85.5 % men, a gap of 71 percentage points. In other words, in both Listener and TLS,
the women in our sample are outweighed by the men by roughly 6:1. Six of the men
in our sample are mentioned before a woman has a chance.

Gender vs. canonicity
If we compare the difference between the frequencies of male and female authors to
that between dead and living authors, we see that, in the Listener, the ratio between
‘ancients’ (♂︎C + ♀︎C) and ‘moderns’ (♂︎ + ♀︎) in these samples is 74.4 % to 25.6 %, a
gap of 48.8 % in favour of the ‘ancients’; in the TLS, it is 77.4 % to 22.6 %, a 54.8 %
gap. Thus, we see (by comparing the gender gap to the canonicity gap) that gender
trumps seniority as a differential category by 17.4 % in the Listener and by 16.2 %
in the TLS.

Chart 2. The size of the gender gap (difference in percentage points between mentions of men and women) compared
to the canonicity gap (difference between mentions of canonical and contemporary authors) in Listener and TLS.

Would it make a difference if we left out the ‘top dogs’ in the male groups, i.e.,
Shakespeare and T. S. Eliot, who are constant cultural and literary reference points
in the period? No; the distribution between men and women would still be
overwhelmingly in favour of men: three to one in the Listener, four to one in the
TLS, even if we disregard Shakespeare and T. S. Eliot.
In the next step, we divide the period into three five-year segments: 1946–50, 1951–
55, and 1956–60, to see how much fluctuation or development we can find in these
groups over time. To maintain comparability between the groups, and for the sake
of practicality, we focus again on the top twenty authors in each group and for each
sub-period. Especially for the groups of modern writers, the top twenty are not the
same for each five-year segment. The ‘ancients’ demonstrate their usual relative
stability. We count the totals for each group of twenty. Once again, the results are
best displayed in the form of a few charts.

Chart 3. Developing frequencies in the Listener in five-year spans, 1946–60.

We can see that the weight of the traditional male canon drops considerably (from
2039 to 1487), but that it still dominates everything else. There is a slight rise in
contemporary male writers, though the frequency remains very stable at around the
500 mark. There is, however, a noticeable drop in the frequency of contemporary
women writers, from 259 to 198, and an even more marked drop in canonical women
writers from 271 to 184. Overall, we can say that the reduced dominance of
references to the traditional literary canon over this fifteen-year period benefits new
male authors more than female ones.
We also want to know how these changes apply to the overall distribution of
references to the male and female authors in our sample, as well as to the relation
between canonical and contemporary authors. We do this in percentages to calculate,
once again, the relative distance between men and women and between canonical
and non-canonical writers in the sample.

Chart 4. How the gender and canonicity gaps evolve in the Listener 1946–60.

This chart shows quite clearly that, while the ratio between canonical and
contemporary authors is developing steadily towards a lower percentage of
canonical authors and a higher percentage of contemporaries, changing by 12.1 %
over these 15 years, the ratio between men and women (both canonical and
contemporary) is favouring more and more men over women, increasing the gender
gap by 2.9 %. The distance between men and women increases while the distance
between canonical and contemporary authors decreases.

For the TLS, the results look as depicted in chart 5:

Chart 5. Developing frequencies in the TLS in five-year spans, 1946–60.

Here, the classical canon, both male and female, is more stable, but we also see a
marked increase in references to contemporary authors, both male and female, with
the contemporary men outweighing contemporary women writers. However, there
is a steady rise of references to contemporary British women writers across the
period.
The slight but steady rise in contemporary British women writers is accompanied by
a slight decline of references to canonical women writers in the last five years of this
period. In the TLS, the invocation of the traditional male canon first sees a slight rise,
then ultimately arrives at its point of origin. Nevertheless, the canon is ultimately
more stable than in the Listener, showing a more traditional, perhaps more
conservative outlook of the magazine.19
Let us look at the distribution ratios between the two main categories of difference
(gender and canonicity) and how they develop in the TLS.

Chart 6. Developing ratios of gender and canonicity in the TLS, 1946–50.

Here the ratios tell a slightly different story; we see a more marked decline in the
preference for canonical authors over contemporary ones (15.2 %, compared to
12.1 % in the Listener), but we also see the dominance of references to male rather
than female authors barely decreasing over the fifteen-year period. Male authors still
dominate; the distance towards their female competitors remains fairly constant.
When we take both these samples together and add them up, we get the following
results: The traditional male canon declines by 5.9 %, the female canon by 1 %. This
decline is accompanied by a slight increase in the attention paid to the top twenty
contemporary women writers (from 511 out of 7096 to 521 out of 6893 = a 0.4 %
rise), but also by a 6.5 % rise in the attention paid to a selection of contemporary
male writers, especially in the years from 1946 to 1955. The attention paid to this
selection of contemporary male authors in these two magazines thus rises by 6.1 %
more than that paid to contemporary women, thus ultimately increasing the ‘gender
gap’ in the literary field (at least in these two samples from the period).

Chart 7. Changing gender and canonicity ratios in TLS and Listener combined.

Chart 7 shows the difference between references to men in relation to references to
women on the one hand, and the difference between references to canonical in
relation to contemporary writers on the other hand. Combining the evidence from
the two journal databases we get a more differentiated overall picture of the literary
field in Britain in the second half of the 1940s and in the 1950s. We see that the
predominance of canonical authors gradually decreases by 13.6 %, but that they still
dominate the field by a wide margin of 45.8 % in the late 1950s. The dead authors
in our sample are mentioned much more frequently in the TLS and the Listener at
this time than living authors.
We also see that women writers are at a clear disadvantage compared to men, dead
or alive, and that men dominate the field by a margin of, on average, 69.1 %. This
margin remains very stable over the entire period. If there is any significant change
at all, it is not in terms of gender but in the slowly growing preference for
contemporary writers rather than canonical authors. The gender ratio, as represented
in these two journals, remains stable and firmly in favour of male writers.

This overview shows once again, but in more detail, how the odds are stacked against

woman writer, but at a 9.1 % disadvantage compared to a male contemporary, and
even at a 60.8 % disadvantage compared to a dead male author from the core canon.
On the other hand, British male contemporary writers are only at a disadvantage of

51.4 % in relation to their famous dead colleagues, or 9.4 % less at a disadvantage
than their female contemporaries. They have an advantage of 8.3 percentage points
over dead women from the canon, only slightly less than their 9.1 % advantage over
their female contemporaries. The canon of dead males is very much alive, and their
advantage against their female counterparts is only slightly less substantial than their
advantage against contemporary women writers: a whopping 60 %.

Later Developments
In a brief follow-up to these findings, we explore how 1950s women writers have
fared, in relation to their male contemporaries, over time. For this, we confine our
attention to the TLS and count the frequencies across the decades, using ten of the
top twenty contemporary women writers and their male counterparts in the TLS
sample for the period 1946–60.

We can see that, among an older generation of women writers, only Elizabeth Bowen
regains her relatively high profile after a period of decline in the 1960s and 70s,
stabilizing and maintaining a strong reputation in the 1980s. Rebecca West, Edith
Sitwell, and Dorothy Sayers remain relatively stable; interest in West actually rises
in the 1970s–80s and again after 2000, while Sitwell loses considerably in the 1960s
102

J OURNAL OF CU LTURAL A NALYTICS

and then remains fairly stable on a lower level. The others remain hardly noticed.
However, we also see Muriel Spark’s reputation, after a slight drop in the 1970s,
constantly on the rise, and Iris Murdoch enjoying the highest reputation among this
group; two younger women writers from the 1950s who have made it to the top.
This top, however, is still relative to the numbers reached by their male colleagues.
The gender gap persists throughout the rest of the 20 th century and into the 21st.
While Iris Murdoch, born in 1919, reaches the highest value (104 mentions) in the
early 2000s, her closest comparable male colleague in terms of generations,
Kingsley Amis (born in 1922), peaks at 137 mentions in the 1980s. Evelyn Waugh
reaches 210 in the 2000s, and Orwell a peak of 350.

Chart 12: Emerging women writers from the 1960s in the TLS 1961–2010.

Here we can see a trio of new female stars rising; however, none of them, not even
Byatt, who peaks at 107 mentions in the 2000s, reaches a competitive margin. Even
though Byatt overtakes Murdoch, she is herself outrun by the likes of Amis and
Waugh. If this experiment shows anything – and one would certainly need to gather
and analyse more data to establish a broader and more representative selection of
writers – it shows that women writers were not only comparatively underrepresented
in the literary canon and the wider cultural field in Britain at mid-century, but that
this underrepresentation still continues, at least inasmuch as it is reflected in the
attention paid to writers by TLS reviewers, in the 20th and early 21st century.20

Conclusion
We find that post-war British women writers between 1946 and 1960 were at a clear
disadvantage compared to male authors, dead or alive. In our samples from the TLS
and the Listener, men dominated the literary field by a margin of, on average,
69.1 %. This margin remained constant over the entire period, although other
parameters changed. We found a slight decrease in the mentions of canonical authors
in favour of contemporary writers. If there is any significant change at all, it is not
in terms of gender but in the slowly growing preference for contemporary writers
rather than canonical authors. Further studies would be needed to establish whether
this is a more common trend in book reviewing after the Second World War.
104

J OURNAL OF CU LTURAL A NALYTICS

To put it bluntly, in these samples, an author who is dead and male stands a much
better chance to be mentioned by name than an author who is male and still alive;
much less of a chance if she is dead and female, and even less if she is female and
still alive. There is no reliable data to test if this is still the case today. One can at
least hope that things have changed since the 1950s.
In this study, we have not been interpreting texts; we merely counted authors’ names,
which we had previously identified according to their gender and canonical status.
In reading book reviews by numbers, we may have given the impression of treating
literature like a competition. Yet literature, like many human activities, is also a
competition (for attention, recognition, cultural capital). Treating it as such and
counting the numbers has allowed us to capture and measure the gender and canon
biases of literary journalism in the post-war era. These biases, in turn, can tell us
much about changing literary tastes and cultural hierarchies, adding to our
knowledge of the historical contexts of production, reception, and canon formation
in which books are read, authors remembered or forgotten, and reputations
established.

In addition to the data collection so far presented, we have also counted the mentions of British women writers in
two newspapers, The Times and the Financial Times. The latter has remained incomplete due to restricted access to
the archives. In The Times, though Sitwell, Sayers, and Bowen also make the top twenty, the leading figure is
Yvonne Mitchell, mentioned 107 times, yet not as an author but an actor. Similarly, Joan Littlewood is mentioned
52 times for her theatre productions or, for example, Enid Blyton 21 times as a popular writer of children’s books.
Although these authors are referred to frequently, the arts sections of these newspapers do not have the same literary

When searching for T. S. Eliot, we made sure to avoid contamination with George Eliot by searching for ‘Eliot
NOT George’, checking manually that the references were indeed to him.
16

17

Mentions of Elizabeth Gaskell include hits for ‘Mrs. Gaskell’, as she was still often called at the time.

Mentions of Samuel Johnson include references to ‘Dr. Johnson’; searching for John Milton, we excluded
references to (Milton) Keynes; searching for Dickens, we excluded references to his great-granddaughter Monica, a
moderately successful woman writer in this period (21 mentions in the TLS). Robert Browning is the most difficult
to count with any degree of certainty, because of his common name but also because of potential confusions with
references to baking, guns, and gravy. Thomas Hardy’s last name also posed difficulties because the TLS database
does not distinguish between ‘Hardy’ and the adjective ‘hardy’. All mentions were checked manually.
18

19

We believe these changes are not attributable to deliberate editorial choices but rather reflective of wider cultural
trends. Although the TLS changed editors twice during the period we investigate, Alan Pryce-Jones was at its helm
between 1948 and 1959, providing a long phase of editorial stability.
20

This phenomenon is not limited to the TLS. Recent surveys by VIDA (a non-profit organisation devoted to gender
parity in the arts) show that many literary magazines still review more books by male than female authors, some by
a factor of two to one. See www.vidaweb.org/the-count/. For Australia, the Stella Count, conducted between 2012
and 2018, offers more hopeful figures. See https://stella.org.au/initiatives/research/stella-count-survey/.
