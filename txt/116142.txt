The relationship between on-screen and off-screen inequality in film industries
and the relative impact of these on movie attendance is widely discussed but
not necessarily empirically demonstrated. This article examines the binary
gender composition of film project teams and the gendered representation of
film characters as factors for cinema attendance. We collected a unique dataset
(N=1285) of all films released during the pre-pandemic decade (2008-2019) in
Russia – at that time the largest European cinema market. A marked-up subset
of 243 films was used to calculate a novel version of the Bechdel-Wallace test
that accounts for the proportion of all non-stereotypical dialogues in the film
narration, as opposed to the classical binary test. Our test proves very
informative, revealing a strikingly high proportion of dialogues with
stereotypical portrayals of women even among the films that pass the BechdelWallace binary threshold. We also undertook a social network analysis (SNA) of
the characters’ communications. This analysis demonstrate that women
predominantly occupy a peripheral position in film plots. Both stereotyping
and marginalization of women are positively related to the proportion of men
in the film crew, especially in the role of screenwriter. Simultaneously, having
more men in key positions is also correlated with access to larger budgets and
better distribution, thus effectively impeding films with stronger women
characters from wider audiences. These audiences, however, show no prejudice
towards films with such characters: after 2015, films featuring central women
protagonists have the same level of attendance as movies without them.
Although Russia exemplifies a large non-Western cinema market, the trends we
identify, particularly the “gatekeeping” effect of male filmmakers, is notably in
line with those observed in Western democracies.

1. Introduction
Issues of skewed gender representation in screen media, including advertising,
film, and television, have been the focus of attention of the feminist
movement and media scholars since the 1970s (see for example, Johnston;
Mulvey). Recently, these issues have attracted wider attention due in part to
the #metoo social movement in which notable producers, directors, actors,
and other stars were alleged to have sexually abused or harassed their junior

Gender (im)balance in the Russian cinema: on the screen and behind the camera

or dependent colleagues (Liddy). In addition to gender inequality, increasing
attention is being paid to its intersections with race, age, and other forms of
discrimination (both on and off-screen) (Conor).
The increasing attention to on-screen gender imbalance and the stereotypical
representation of characters is also related to the growing understanding
of its social consequences. Most important is the possible effect of media
images on human behavior and in particular, on wider instances of gender
discrimination (Aley and Hahn; 21st Century Fox and The Geena Davis
Institute on Gender in Media, et al.). As a response to these concerns, some
film industries have made small gestures to gender equality, for example
backing films with stronger than previous female protagonists. Hollywood
studios, for instance, have modified traditional franchise plots to enable
greater diversity in their cast such as the more recent Star Wars movies (Lopez;
Vainikka). However, a recent aggregate report on the top 100 grossing films
in Hollywood sounds a note of caution. In 2021 the Centre for the Study
of Women in Film and Television identified that women accounted for only
35% of major characters in the top 100 grossing films, down slightly from
38% in 2020 and 37% in 2019 (Lauzen 6). Women comprised only 34% of
all speaking characters, also down slightly from 36% in 2020 (Lauzen 7).
Although the percentage of films featuring women protagonists increased
by 2 percentage points to 29% in 2021, this is well below the high of 40%
achieved in 2019. The Centre’s report found that after two years of promising
gains, 2021’s percentage of women protagonists was the same as in 2016
– the year before the start of the #MeToo movement (Lauzen 4–5). What
seems on the surface to be an increase of women in substantial screen roles
is not necessarily supported by the quantitative evidence. This paper similarly
develops a quantitative approach to the problem of gender discrimination on
screen with a unique focus on the Russian film industry.
To address on-screen gender imbalance and its dynamics quantitatively,
several measurements have been offered (Kagan et al.; Kapoor et al.; Jones
et al.) and their relation to film success has been estimated (Treme et al.;
Lindner et al., “Million Dollar Maybe?”). The most popular index, the
Bechdel-Wallace (BW) test (Bechdel), is a simple binary indicator (yes/no)
of the presence of at least one conversation between two or more women
touching on non-stereotypical topics. However, being binary, it provides no
information about the actual proportion of non-stereotypical conversations
or characters in the films. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose
a BW test modification (BWL) that scores films according to the share of
conversations between women characters on qualified topics.
In its current form, the BW test has been widely used to study on-screen
gender balance both in films from Western democracies (Agarwal et al.;
Garcia et al.; Lindner et al., “Million Dollar Maybe?”; Lindner and Schulting)
and, a lesser extent, beyond (Kapoor et al.). Likewise, as the collection

Journal of Cultural Analytics

Gender (im)balance in the Russian cinema: on the screen and behind the camera

of gender statistics on filmmakers is becoming a common practice of
government agencies worldwide, behind-the-camera gender balance is also
being increasingly studied with a variety of quantitative approaches based on
the number of women in key positions in film crews, their access to large
budgets and financial state support (Dean; Follows et al.; Liddy).
The study of gender in Russian cinema predominantly focuses on cinematic
rather than sociological questions. The most notable study is Lynne
Attwood’s 1993 edited collection, Red Women on the Silver Screen. In the
first parts of this volume, both international and local researchers analyze
the changing image of women in Soviet films from the standpoint of the
perestroika era on the eve of the collapse of the USSR. The articles in
the collection trace the evolution of the “woman question” from prerevolutionary femmes fatales to the strong, joyful, purposeful, and confident
workers of socialist realism in the 1930s and the various images of women
in decades following. In the 1940s, selfless home front workers, and faithful
wives awaiting their husbands from the war, appeared on the screens. In the
1950s, women acquired the everyday attractiveness of the “girl next door”.
In the 1960s, they were reimagined as refined companions and even the
occasional antagonists of men protagonists. In the 1970s, there were echoes
of the Western second wave of feminism in Soviet films, with the conflict
of the emancipated woman caught between career and personal life: either
unsettled in love or overburdened with domestic duties, and typically caught
in a vicious spiral of double exploitation. (Bulgakova) The ambiguity of
women’s position in the Soviet Union was particularly evident during this
time, especially in the comedies of Eldar Ryazanov (Rojavin and Harte). By
the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, the screens were flooded
with sex and violence that had long been restrained by censorship.
The various authors of the perestroika anthology critically evaluate the
cinema’s representation of women as a political proxy, a continuation of a
long tradition of symbolically portraying the motherland through women.
and extended in the Soviet era to exemplification of the state’s relationship
with its citizens. The authors describe this portrayal as cynical and
duplicitous, reflecting contempt for “woman-motherland” and the desire to
humiliate her as a sublimation of the suppressed Soviet society over many
years. (Drozdova; Attwood, “Part 1. Women, Cinema and Society’”)
Since this important publication, very little substantive research on women
and the cinema has been available for Russia. One exception is a publication
from 2021 that covers crossover art-mainstream films of the 2010s and
observes that women’s cinema in this period shifted towards romanticizing
traditional values as a general basis for its narratives. These films exploit the
legitimacy of “female power in powerlessness” in the increasingly entrenched
patriarchal discourse of the country. (Артюх).

For the most part, however, the Russian film-making community is broadly
indifferent to the global gender agenda. Furthermore, a properly inclusive
understanding of gender-related practices in the global film industry is only
possible by analyzing large non-Western markets of which Russia is an
important representative.
As of 2020, the first pandemic year, the Russian film industry amounted
to approximately 360 feature film production companies (Леонтьева et al.)
which released 110-186 films per year (Kanzler and Simone, “Focus 2022
World Film Market Trends”) and employed about 26,000 professionals
(Leontyeva and Danilov). Russian audiences were enthusiastic film
consumers. In 2017, Russia, with 212 million tickets sold, took first place
in terms of cinema attendance in Europe, beating the previously permanent
leader – France (209 million admissions) (Kanzler and Simone, “Focus 2022
World Film Market Trends”). Two years later, in 2019, Russia established a
European record with around 220 million cinema tickets sold (Kanzler and
Simone, “Focus 2020 World Film Market Trends”).
Given this, the absence of research on gender balance in Russian movies
presents an obvious gap. This paper seeks to close it by offering a rigorous
and comprehensive examination of gender inequality both on and off the
screen in the Russian film industry in the pre-pandemic period (2008-2019).
Specifically, we seek to establish the relationship between the gender
composition of “key creative” crew members (producer, writer, and director),
on-screen female representation (measured with a number of proposed
methods, including BWL), and the theatrical admissions of the films. We
also trace the dynamics of several gender-related processes in the Russian film
industry. To do so, we use a complete database of all the Russian feature
films shown on the big screen in Russia and in the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) between 2008 and 2019. Different subtasks employ
different subsets of this database, including the sample of 243 films manually
marked up using our BWL test.
The paper consists of six sections, including this introduction. The next
section reviews the relevant literature and develops our hypotheses. The third
section describes data and methods used in this article for measuring onscreen and behind-the-camera gender inequality. The fourth section presents
the results of the analysis and their discussion. The paper ends with the
Limitations and Conclusion sections.

2. Literature review and hypotheses
2.1. Measuring gender inequality in the production crew
Existing theories and practices of studying gender inequality in the film
industry globally have been largely shaped by the respective research done by
various non-government organizations promoting gender equality, including
the Annenberg Foundation (S.L. Smith et al., “Inequality in 1,200 Popular
Journal of Cultural Analytics

4

Gender (im)balance in the Russian cinema: on the screen and behind the camera

Films: Examining Portrayals of Gender, Race/Ethnicity”; S.L. Smith et al.,
“Inequality in 1 ,300 Popular Films : Examining Portrayals of Gender”), the
Geena Davis Institute (Stacy L. Smith et al.), the New York Film Academy
(Perrone), the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film
(Lauzen), the International Federation of Actors (Dean), and the European
Audiovisual Observatory that, unlike others, focuses on international
comparisons (Fontaine; Simone). These various organizations produce both
reports and databases that are subsequently widely reused by the academic
community.
The focus of these reports is on the proportion of women among producers,
directors, screenwriters, and sometimes composers and directors of
photography (with the two latter professions demonstrating fewer women)
(Simone). Among the three major film types, documentary film production
was found to be the easiest for women to enter in all three “key creative” film
crew roles (producer, writer, and director), followed by live-action fiction and
animation films in the second and third positions, respectively (Simone). This
effect is closely related to film budgets: the more expensive the production is,
the smaller the share of women. Thus, the budget difference between fiction
and documentary films in Austria in 2011-2013 was revealed to be especially
important, with the gender gap higher in the former (Hetherington Raveney
et al. 523). In Sweden in 2013-2017 films with men directors, producers,
and writers were found to have budgets that were higher than those available
for women by four, seven, and six million SEK, respectively (Wikstrand J.
11). British data from 2008-2014 showed that only 3.3% of films budgeted
above 30 million GBP were directed by women, while among low and microbudget films (under 500,000 GBP) women-directed works comprised 16%
(Follows et al. 20). A French study has revealed that in 2008-2017 the average
budget of women-directed films used to be 3.33 million EUR, against 5.7
million EUR for films directed by men (Piccon et al.). Moreover, Centre
national du cinéma et de l’image animée found out that distribution budgets
for women-directed films were lower by 34.4% (Piccon et al.). Verhoeven
et al. using the data from 40 countries and 3.4 thousand films distributed
between 2012 and 2015, proved poor access of women not only to funding
but also to the screening infrastructure: in their sample, films directed solely
by women accounted for only 3% of international screenings (Verhoeven et al.
140) (simultaneously, the number of screens for films made by mixed teams
was 3-4 times higher than for those made solely by women (Verhoeven et al.
143–44)).
In the third part of the volume by Lynne Attwood, mentioned in the
introduction, the behind-the-camera situation in Russian cinema was
revealed via a historical perspective and a series of interviews with key Russian
filmmakers from the perestroika era. Attwood and her co-authors pondered
the concept of “women’s cinema” and traced the history of Russian female
directors from Olga Preobrazhenskaya, who directed her first film in 1916,
Journal of Cultural Analytics

5

Gender (im)balance in the Russian cinema: on the screen and behind the camera

to Esther Shub, Darya Zhukova, Yulia Solntseva, and Margarita Barskaya,
to Dinara Asanova, Larisa Shepitko, and Kira Muratova, many of whom
were skeptical of the concept of “women’s cinema” per se and tried not
to emphasize their gender. (Turovskaya) The following interviews testify to
the blatant discrimination against women applying to study at the VGIK
(the main Soviet film institute in Moscow) and the subsequent need to
continually prove their worth during and after their education not only as
professionals but also as women. The publication makes for dismal readings
as women directors, cinematographers, and screenwriters reveal misogyny,
survivor bias (some of them try to ignore discrimination against themselves
or their colleagues), adaptability (using both professional and personal
collaborations such as marriage to ensure an acting or screenwriting career),
and stereotypical thinking (“Children must be born!”). They acknowledge
the industry’s unsuitability for women who bear the burden of household
chores and motherhood and yet show no signs of a feminist view of the
problems. During a period of heightened instability and hopes, they were
primarily concerned with the then-recent reform of the film industry, which
abolished censorship and proclaimed the commercial freedom of film
production and distribution (Vizitei; Attwood, “‘Some Interviews on
Personal Questions...’: Soviet Women Talk About Their Experiences in the
Film Industry’”).
Given how little emphasis has been placed on feminist interventions in
Russian cinema neither the filmmaking community nor any respective
institutions have been yet involved in the regular gathering of gender
statistics. The first-ever statistical analysis of the share of women producers,
directors, screenwriters, and directors of photography (DOP) in Russian
cinema was carried out by the European Audiovisual Observatory. An
especially small number of women has been revealed among DOPs: women
dominated the creative teams of DOPs in less than 3% of films that were
released theatrically in 2013-2017 (a female-dominated team was defined as a
team with 50% or more of women on the position of DOP) (Leontyeva et
al.). The proportion of films shot under the direction of women during the
same period was 15.9%, while film crews dominated by women scriptwriters
and producers comprised the largest share – about 22% each. The analysis
of the extended version of this dataset spanning from 2009 to 2019 (Артюх
236–42) shows that women’s teams make cheaper films and receive less direct
state support; it is not surprising that their films are less popular among the
audiences.
As these studies use descriptive statistics only, in this paper we seek to test
the revealed trends with inferential statistics by proposing the following
hypotheses:
H1. The higher the proportion of women among filmmakers in
key creative positions, the smaller the film budget is.

Journal of Cultural Analytics

H2. The higher the proportion of women among filmmakers in
key creative positions, the lower a film distributor’s power is.
H3. The higher the proportion of women among filmmakers in
key creative positions, the lower the attendance of Russian films
in the CIS is.
Additionally, we seek to test our Russia-specific assumptions concerning the
changes in the Russian film community that took place around 2015. As
we see a certain rise in attention to gender equality after 2015, we anticipate
a decrease in the strength of the influence of men filmmakers on film
popularity.
H4. After 2015 the (positive) effect of the proportion of men
among filmmakers on theatrical attendance is smaller than
before.

2.2. Measuring on-screen gender inequality – the BechdelWallace test
As noted above, a popular simple method for examining gender bias on
the screen is the Bechdel-Wallace test. It asks whether there are at least two
women characters in the film, preferably with names, who talk to each other
about something other than men (Bechdel). Shockingly, as much as 44% of
Hollywood films fail to overcome this low threshold while only 56% meet one
to three requirements (Bechdel Test Movie List). For Russia, the only available
data for running this test has been on 75 films and TV shows collected
in a journalism project by Konstantin Zarubin and Elizaveta Soldatova (А
Бабы Здесь Тихие. Тестом Бехдель По Нашему Кино). Of these 75 films,
37% passed the test, and additionally, 20% were borderline – together they
comprise a proportion similar to 56% that found for Hollywood films.
Several studies have pointed out the limitations of the BW test, which
originated in a cartoon strip and was never intended to be a scholarly method.
Amongst them is its inability to account for central or even non-stereotypical
women characters who are not involved in dialogues with other women
(Agarwal et al.). The test does not allow us to determine whether women
characters are equally strong throughout the narrative or whether they are
presented as atypical outliers (Jones), or even whether they simply talk more
than once (Kagan et al.). Despite these shortcomings, the BW test is used not
only in academic research but in industry practice as well. Thus, Eurimages, a
European cinema support fund, is employing this test for monitoring gender
bias in scripts submitted to its competition (“Eurimages’ Gender Equality
Strategy (2021-2023): Equal Voices for Equal Talent”).
As a response to the criticism of the BW test, new methods for measuring
gender centrality and marginality based on social network analysis (SNA)
have been developed. Agarwal et al. propose 43 SNA features to classify films
Journal of Cultural Analytics

7

Gender (im)balance in the Russian cinema: on the screen and behind the camera

as gender balanced. Kagan et al. introduce the Gender Degree Ratio (GDR)
indicator calculated as a ratio of the total female characters’ degree centrality
to that of the male characters:

The authors propose films with 0.8> GDR> 1.2 to be considered balanced
(Kagan et al. 8). Pete Jones (Jones; Jones et al.) criticizes static network
metrics as unable to reflect the focus of viewer attention on the heroines
in the context of the storyline. He suggests methods of dynamic network
analysis accounting for the communication of characters during the entire
film by calculating character centralities in each dialogue and by further
plotting them as graphs of centrality by time.
The relationship between the gender of onscreen characters and the gender
of the filmmaking teams that produce them is another fruitful area of
analysis with calls for close attention to this phenomenon (Lindner et al.,
“Million Dollar Maybe?”). Researchers have previously noted that the gender
of the filmmakers is directly related to the visibility of the female characters
they portray (Smith and Choueiti; Linke and Prommer; S.L. Smith et al.,
“Inequality in 1,100 Popular Films: Examining Portrayals of Gender, Race/
Ethnicity”). Based on these considerations our next hypothesis is:
H5. The higher the proportion of women among filmmakers, (a)
the higher the centrality of female characters, and (b) the less
stereotypical their representation is.
The benefits of increasing the number of women onscreen are manifold.
From the social point of view, media images are influential in shaping people’s
gender beliefs and behavior, for example, inspiring gender identifications
from childhood (Aley and Hahn), and limiting the choice of career paths
for girls (21st Century Fox and The Geena Davis Institute on Gender in
Media, et al.). There are also debates on the economic benefits of enhancing
the profile of women on screen. Shift7 and Creative Artists Agency (Shift7
and CAA), based on an analysis of 350 most popular studio films from
2014-2017, showed a positive relationship between passing the BechdelWallace test and film box office, whereas Treme et al. have argued that the
presence of a male star increased the box office in the home market by 12%,
and a female star had no effect on the success of films from 1990 to 2010.
Lindner and Schulting and Lindner et al. examine the relation between
Bechdel-Wallace test results and film performance among critics and
audiences. They find that for wide audiences this relationship, initially
negative, is rendered insignificant when film genre and budget size are
introduced in the model. Consequently, according to Lindner, this initial
negative relationship is explained not by the audience’s prejudices, but by
the work of “gatekeepers” who protect the industry from expensive projects

with strong female characters. Perhaps more surprisingly, Lindner notes that
the critics’ assessments of films free from stereotypical female images are not
hostile.
Developing the ideas of Lindner, we propose the following two additional
hypotheses:
H6. (a) The higher the degree centrality of female characters and
(b) the lower their stereotyping in dialogues is, the higher the
attendance of Russian films in the CIS is.
H7. After 2015, the (positive) effect of (a) female centrality and
(b) female character non-stereotyping on attendance is higher
than before 2015.
A conceptual model of the hypotheses and variables relationships is presented
in Fig. 1.

3. Method and data
3.1. Datasets and mark-up
We use a dataset (N=1285) that includes all Russian films produced between
2008 and 2019 and theatrically released between December 1, 2008, and
December 31, 2019 (referred to as the full dataset). Distribution statistics
cover the territory of the CIS of which the Russian Federation is the biggest
market. Budget information is available for 644 films, and BWL test markup – for 243 films (further referred to as the marked-up dataset). Both of
the latter subsamples are relatively evenly distributed through period the 12

years of our analysis (Fig. 2). The datasets alongside the detailed description
of all variables are available in the supplement to the article at https://doi.org/
10.7910/DVN/GDKOSR.
The sample for BWL markup was constructed to represent three types of
films: blockbusters, moderately popular, and films of festival appeal, and
additionally included 21 films that could not be categorized. Within this
sample, a team of 94 volunteers chose the films for mark-up. The coders
developed a contingency matrix of characters by scenes where the role of
the former in the latter was coded as either speechless participation,
communication on a qualified topic, or communication on one of the
disqualified topics (about relationships between men and women, beauty,
fashion, or about children and housekeeping).
The matrix was used as the input data to calculate the BWL score.

3.2. Variables
Main dependent variable
Attendance: the number of cinema tickets sold.

Other variables tested in hypotheses
Behind-the-scenes gender balance. DirMaleShare, ProdMaleShare, and
ScrMaleShare are calculated as the proportion of males among all people
in the position of director, producer, and screenwriter, respectively, for each
film. The aggregated variable maleshare is an accumulated proportion of
Journal of Cultural Analytics

10

Gender (im)balance in the Russian cinema: on the screen and behind the camera

men in all three positions together. Binary sex (male or female) was identified
automatically based on a list of male and female first names and the endings
of surnames; it was also checked manually if needed.
Female representation on the screen is measured with BWL and gender degree
ratio (Kagan et al.) calculated for two kinds of networks.
BWL (Bechdel-Wallace test modified by Leontyeva): proportion of dialogues
among female characters on qualified topics in the total number of the
film dialogues (formula 2). Being an extension of the initial Bechdel-Wallace
(Lindner et al., “Million Dollar Maybe?”), BWL differs both from the
classical binary variant and the four-point scale proposed by Agarwal et al.
and Bechdel Test Movie List (https://bechdeltest.com/).

The disqualified topics were not only about men, as in the classical test,
but also about women, beauty, fashion, attractiveness, children, and
housekeeping. This definition of the set of stereotypical themes associated
with women is based on a stream of prior research (Kapoor et al.). Mixed
conversations, in which both disqualified and general topics were mentioned,
were considered qualified. Only characters who participated in more than one
scene (or in one, but important, according to the coder) and had at least one
line of dialogue were marked up. Monologues were excluded.
The gender degree ratio (GDR) of a film is calculated from the bimodal
network of characters and dialogues in which they participate throughout
the entire movie. For this purpose, an unimodal weighted projection of this
network is constructed where the vertices are characters only, and the arcs
between each pair of vertices represent the number of dialogues in which
both characters in the pair have participated. Once, based on this data, the
weighted centrality for each character is obtained, the sum of centralities of
all female characters is divided by the respective sum for males. Gender degree
ratio total (GDRT) differs from GDR with the input data only: instead
of dialogues, all scenes are used, including those where a given character is
participating silently. Unlike the BW test which aims to assess stereotyping
of women, these network measures evaluate women’s overall importance in a
film, as compared to men.
The film budget (BudgetALL) and the amount of state support (StateSup)
were measured in rubles and adjusted for inflation. The power of the
distribution company which is its capability to book film widely was
evaluated via a proxy parameter – company type (DistrType). It is a nominal
variable with four levels, where 4 is assigned to representatives of Hollywood
major studios that possess the highest power; 3 – to representatives of

Journal of Cultural Analytics

11

Gender (im)balance in the Russian cinema: on the screen and behind the camera

Russian leading producers; 2 – to independent distributors; 1 – to selfdistributors (producers who release their films without the mediation of a
distribution company and possess the lowest power).
Threshold is a binary variable that assigns each film to one of the two
categories based on its year of release in CIS, either before or in and after
2015. This year was chosen based on ad-hoc tests and qualitative movie
industry analysis. This was the year when the attention of the professional
cinema community to the gender of filmmakers experienced a shift. Among
other things, a special out-of-competition program appeared at the Moscow
International Film Festival, and women’s films began to win at Kinotavr, the
most prestigious film festival of Russian cinema.

Control variables
Data for determining film genre was retrieved from (КиноПоиск)
https://www.kinopoisk.ru/ where each film usually gets multiple genre
assignments. Based on factor analysis (see details in the supplement available
at https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/GDKOSR) we created enlarged groups of
genres to reduce the dimensionality of the indicator. Six numeric variables
express the proportion of each genre in a film: drama (Drm), comedy (Cmd),
family (Fml), suspense (Ssp), dynamic (Dyn), and prestige (Prs). Some of
them were excluded from some models due to multicollinearity. The film
genre is distinct from the film type that represents four categories (top,
average, festival, and undefined) used to compile our sample for BWL markup, as described above.
Russian film age rating (AgeRateRu) is a nominal variable with four
categories: 0/6+, 12+, 14/16+, and 18+ which unites two ranking systems
that existed in Russia before and after the reform of 2012, respectively.
The season factor is controlled by two variables: the number of days off in
the Russian Federation on the week of the film release (VacDays) and the
number of films that were released in the same week (Competitors).
As the Russian cinema market was fast growing in terms of the number of
screens through the period under investigation, their average number as of the
beginning and the end of the month, when the film was released (ScrRU), is
controlled for. It is being done to compensate for the lack of information on
the number of screens booked for every film.

3.3. Data analysis
All data analysis was carried out in R version 3.6.1 (2019-07-05). The main
method for testing hypotheses was linear regression. Confirmatory factor
analysis (CFA) was applied for genre aggregation. Structural equation

modeling (SEM) for the theoretical model as it is presented in Fig. 1 was not
applicable as different samples were used for the research of different parts of
the scheme.

4. Results and Discussion
4.1. Descriptive statistics
Descriptive statistics of the datasets used for the analysis are presented in
Table 1 (full dataset) and Table 2 (marked-up dataset).
In terms of unique persons working on the projects included in the full
sample, the overall female share is 19.7%; female producers make up 20.6% of
the sample, screenwriters – 19.8%, and directors – 17.5% (Table 3).

4.2. Women behind the camera and their access to resources
The results of the study show that, like in other countries, men dominate
among the key creators of Russian films (Fig. 3). Single-gender film crews
with men in all three key creative positions (producers, directors, and
screenwriters) produced 575 movies out of 1285 during the studied decade;
all producers were men in 723 movies, all writers – in 849, and all directors –
in 1023.
Regression analysis demonstrates a positive linear relationship between the
log-transformed film budget and the proportion of men in the team (Table
4). In other words, men have access to higher budgets in the Russian film
industry thus fully confirming H1. However, at the same time, the amount
of state support is not related to the gender composition of the key film crew
members. Male producers, but not directors or screenwriters have access to
the strongest distributors on the market: representatives of Hollywood majors
and the leading Russian studios. Formally, this means that H2 is only partially
confirmed, however, producers are generally more important for access to
resources than either directors or screenwriters. Overall, these results are in
line with those received for other countries (e.g. Follows et al.; Piccon et al.;
Verhoeven et al.).

4.3. Women behind the camera and film theatrical attendance
Linear regression analysis of film crew gender composition effects on logtransformed film attendance (Table 5) shows that the proportion of men
among screenwriters was not significant in any models. When the budget is
controlled for, the significance of the proportion of males in the other two
key roles decreases with only the effect of the producers’ gender sustaining in
all models. This renders H3 partially confirmed. An explanation for this may
lie in the fact that men producers have access not only to larger budgets but
most importantly, to stronger distributors.

The influence of the changes in the Russian film industry occurring in
and after 2015 on the relationship between the proportion of men among
filmmakers and attendance (H4) has been tested with three respective
interaction terms. As it can be seen, H4 has to be entirely rejected, which
means that after 2015 films, on average, got as much gain in attendance from
producers being men as before 2015.

4.4. The representation of women on the screen
Based on the BWL test results of 243 Russian films it turns out that only
161 films or 61% pass it in terms of the binary approach – passed/not
passed (Fig. 4 a): in these films, there were two women who talked to each
other about something other than men (or such disqualified topics as beauty
practices, housekeeping, children, and other women). Moreover, if we look
at the proportion of conversations between women, the result is even more
shocking: among those 61% that do pass the test, 69 films (28% of the

marked-up dataset) yield a BWL score that does not exceed 5% of all dialogues
(Fig. 4 b). This result shows that female characters in Russian films are
represented quite stereotypically.
Likewise, in most of the films reviewed, both indicators of gender degree ratio
(GDR & GDRT) are less than 0.8 (Fig. 5), which according to (Kagan et al.)
indicates a prevalence of men among the most central characters. Thus, these
two network indicators show that not only the speech of Russian women
characters is represented stereotypically, but they are not at all at the center
of narration in the majority of films.

4.5 Women crews and the representation of women on screen
The gender composition of the key crew members in the marked-up dataset
is slightly skewed towards men, compared to the full dataset (see Table 6 vs
Table 3). As this limitation may have affected the results presented below, they
should be treated with a certain amount of caution.

Linear regression analysis results for three dimensions of women’s
representation, taken as the dependent variables are presented in Table 7.
The strong and significant negative relationship between the proportion of
males among the key crew members, on the one hand, and the BWL test,
GDR, and GDRT, on the other (models 1, 5, and 9) is mostly explained
by the contribution of screenwriters (models 4, 8 and 12). At the same
time, the effects of the proportions of men among directors and producers
are either insignificant or not as strong and not as significant. Nevertheless,
the centrality of female characters is related to the gender composition
of the filmmakers, in full agreement with H5 and in concordance with
previous research that observed a correlation between the presence of women
protagonists and the gender composition of the crew. This correlation was
found to be significant not only for writers (Russian researchers have long
noted the particular importance of female screenwriters for domestic
women’s cinema – to a greater extent than abroad (Turovskaya 148)), but
also for directors and, to a lesser degree, for producers on TV (Linke and
Prommer) and in family films (Smith and Choueiti).

4.6. Women’s on-screen representation and film theatrical
attendance
A key hypothesis for this study (H6) is that films in which women characters
are more central and less stereotyped (measured by the BWL test and two
indices of gender degree ratio) are more interesting for the audience.
Additionally, we expected positive changes in the viewers’ attitudes to the
films with central female characters after 2015 (H7). Twelve linear regression
models that test these hypotheses are presented in Table 8.
The table includes only those control variables from the initial theoretical
model diagram (Fig. 1) that are significant in at least one model. Among
them, the largest effects belong to the distributor type and film type. From
the variety of aggregated genres, only comedy and family demonstrate a
significant (and positive) relationship with film attendance and only in the
models controlling for the movie’s budget. The latter is always a significant
predictor of attendance.

Gender (im)balance in the Russian cinema: on the screen and behind the camera

Figure 6. Effect of threshold (before/after 2015) on the relationship between log-transformed GDR (a) and GDRT (b)
and log-transformed attendance.

Among independent variables of interest, the BWL test score is positively
related to film attendance (model 1), but its significance is weak and the
effect disappears when the budget is introduced into the model (2). GDR and
GDRT are associated with attendance negatively but insignificantly (models
3-6). We can conclude that H6 has to be rejected. These results are in
line with some previous research (Lindner et al., “Million Dollar Maybe?”)
and can be interpreted similarly, as the absence of evidence for the negative
perception of strong female characters by the Russian viewers.
However, the effects of interactive terms involving threshold (for which
we took the 2015 year when gender in films started to be appreciated in
Russia) are positive and significant when also involving GDR and GDRT,
but not BWL. As shown by our more detailed post-hoc analysis (Fig. 6),
female centrality measured both as GDR and GDRT has a negative effect
on attendance only before 2015, while this effect ceases to exist after 2015
(the weak positive relationship is insignificant p>0.2). This suggests that while
Russian viewers were skeptical about attending movies with strong female
characters before gender equality was on the public agenda, their attitude has
changed in favor of the propensity to attend films independently of female
centrality. This coincides with the global trend (Lopez; Vainikka). Although
formally H7 should be rejected based on the opposite direction of both
GDR and GDRT found before 2015, conceptually, the change that occurs
after 2015 is in line with our assumption (i.e. we did assume and did reveal
the growth of tolerance towards strong female characters). However, this
evidence is to be treated with caution due to the small effect size and large
confidence intervals observed.

5. Limitations
Some factors related to cinema attendance and recommended by previous
research were not introduced into the models due to their unavailability
or irrelevance to the Russian cinema market. Only the binary gender of
film crew members and on-screen characters is considered; the attribution of

Gender (im)balance in the Russian cinema: on the screen and behind the camera

gender is based only on names and does not represent the self-identification
of the crew. Similarly, while the terms “sex” and “gender” are used
interchangeably in this paper the authors do not presume that women or
men are biologically defined. The theatrical distribution data used has several
shortcomings, but it is the only available dataset on the CIS market, and it
is widely recognized as a reliable proxy for decision-making by commercial
companies and public bodies.

6. Conclusions
In our study, we have proposed a continuous version of the Bechdel-Wallace
test (BWL) calculated as a proportion of qualified dialogues between women
in Russian films. Our results show that such a metric renders additional
useful information about on-screen gender balance: in particular, we have
shown that even among the films that do pass the test the proportion of nonstereotypical dialogues is strikingly low. This situation calls both for a wider
use of more nuanced metrics and for more action towards gender equality in
the film industry.
Our research contributes to the study of gender in global cinema industries
by investigating a large non-Western market and by introducing a new
marked-up dataset available for further independent scrutiny. Focusing on
binary gender imbalance in the Russian film industry from 2008 to 2019,
our study has considered seven hypotheses, of which four were partially or
fully confirmed and three were rejected (see Table 9). We confirm several
trends observed in other countries that point to the lack of women behind
the camera and their stereotypical representation on the screen. The study
shows the importance of female screenwriters for representing stronger female
characters and, simultaneously, the dominance of male producers and
directors in the access to resources which leads to higher popularity of their
films. These two trends together result in preventing non-stereotypical female
characters from reaching wider audiences. At the same time, Russian data
demonstrates the absence of a relationship between the success of the film
and indicators of gender bias towards the female characters, which does not
support a prejudice of strong women as an unpopular image. This means
that Russian audiences before 2020 were potentially ready to attend movies
with non-stereotypical portrayals of women and that it was not viewers’ biases
that prevented strong women from being more widely represented on-screen.
Finally, the analysis of the change in the Russian audience’s attitude towards
women on the screen provides suggestive evidence for the decrease of the
negative effect of strong female characters on attendance: this effect, although
weak, could be observed before 2015, but entirely disappeared after that.
Further research could enlarge the existing marked-up dataset which would
allow testing our conceptual model with structural equation modeling in a
single statistical framework.

Hypothesis

Result

H1
H1: The higher the proportion of women among filmmakers in key
creative positions, the smaller the film budget is

Confirmed

H2
H2: The higher the proportion of women among filmmakers in key
creative positions, the lower a film distributor’s power is

Partially confirmed (for producers)

H3
H3: The higher the proportion of women among filmmakers in key
creative positions, the lower the attendance of Russian films in the
CIS is

Partially confirmed (for producers)

H4
H4: After 2015, the (positive) effect of the proportion of men among
filmmakers on theatrical attendance is smaller than before

Rejected

H5
H5: The higher the proportion of women among filmmakers, (a) the
higher the centrality of female characters and (b) the less
stereotypical their representation are

Confirmed

H6
H6: (a) The higher the centrality of female characters and (b) the
lower their stereotyping in dialogues are, the higher the attendance
of Russian films in the CIS is

Rejected

H7
H7: After 2015, the (positive) effect of (a) female centrality and (b)
female character non-stereotyping on attendance is higher than
before 2015

Partially confirmed for GDR and GDRT, where the
negative effect of (a) becomes insignificant after 2015.
For BWL (b) it is insignificant.

Data availability statement
The database of film production in Russia and film distribution in the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) before 2018 was received from
Nevafilm Research, later data was collected from the open sources such as
Russian Cinema Fund Analytics, Russian Film Business Today, Booker’s
Bulletin magazines, and Kinopoisk.ru.

Funding details
The study was implemented in the framework of the Basic Research Program
at the National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE
University).
