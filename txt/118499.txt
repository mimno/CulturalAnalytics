The present paper is an attempt at importing network analysis as a method and
applying it to a field that has hitherto been examined in different ways: the
study of national cinema. The approach was motivated by the perceived
conundrum in the existing studies of German cinema that filmhistorical and
political history usually do not match. The aim is to open up another
perspective on the problem of periodization by looking at the data of film
production, more specifically of collaboration. By using a comprehensive data
set which is made availavable by the Filmportal, the central internet platform on
German film, the approach in this paper is to look at the key creatives involved
in the production of a film in the period from 1919 to 1939 and to
conceptualize collaboration and connectivity in a (national) film culture
through the use of network research methods.

As more data sets in good quality become available, as tools that help us
understand big data are developed and gain traction, as researchers acquire
knowledge and experience about meaningful methods for using large pools of
information, we are faced with the task of testing our hypotheses in new ways.
Of course, the “datafication” of film studies is a complex process that has
institutional as well as economical impact, it requires us to rethink methods
as well as study programmes (because students need new skills), it calls for
new introductions and reflections (Arnold and Tilton). At the same time,
we need to take the risk of breaking new ground in our research methods
which implies the possibility of failure. The present paper is an attempt at
importing a method – network analysis – and applying it to a field that
has hitherto been examined in different ways: the study of national cinema.
As certain misunderstandings are rather common, it is important to note at
the start that this paper does not propose an ultimately better way of doing
film history nor does it imply a replacement of existing approaches, but it
rather ventures down a different path. By using a comprehensive data set
and reverting to methods of network analysis, our paper is trying to break
new ground for the study of national cinema. The approach was motivated
by the perceived conundrum in the existing studies of German cinema that
filmhistorical and political history usually do not match.

Approaching a National Film History through Data. Network Analysis in German Film History

Of course, there is a larger question looming behind the question what
can be considered a national cinema which cannot be addressed here in
total. Film studies has a tradition of critical engagement with the concept of
national cinema, its vicissitudes and pitfalls (see e.g. Higson; Vitali; Christie).
There are, of course, many good reasons why traditional film histories that
most often rely on the unquestioned triad of nation, work, and author – as
conventional national film histories did – have gone out of fashion. And we
certainly do not want to attempt a rescue mission of these approaches from
the dustbin of history. Yet again, approaching a national film history as a
whole can be attempted on the basis of the available data which is what this
essay proposes. Whether this is the entirety (or even totality) of a national
cinema is a different question, but it is – in terms of data – at least a more
comprehensive base on which we are building.

Break or continuity – how to periodize German film history?
The disasters of German history this century have left their mark
on the cinema, and even more so on the image and idea we have
of it.
Thomas Elsaesser (1995, 172)
In recent decades, there have been few attempts to consider German film
history in its entirety. The last major attempt with a claim to providing a
general overview of German film history, written in German, has not been
updated for 20 years (Jacobsen et al.). More recent publications focusing on
German film history as a whole have not only been written without exception
in English, they announce their reservations and limited scope already in their
titles. One title proclaims the book to be a “critical history” (Brockmann),
even if the classic canon is worked through. A similar approach, offering
a series of analyses of canonical films, can be found in another anthology
(Garncarz and Ligensa). A third publication is announced as a “new history”
(Kapczynski and Richardson) because conceptually the texts are oriented
rather towards events and discourses than towards works and persons. This
limited claim also applies to other studies as well: one anthology immediately
places history in the plural and relates these “histories” to genre development
(Fisher), while another collection proposes multiple approaches to historical,
as well as aesthetic and theoretical questions of German cinema, making it
more of a scholarly compendium (Bergfelder et al.). All of these books are
similar insofar as they take a limited sample (usually a small group of films,
sometimes persons or events) and consider this as a representative subset of
the whole.
Besides the question of comprehensiveness (the data basis), there is also
the question of internal periodization. German film history has often been
divided into periods according to the political ruptures and the frequent
system changes that have characterized the history of the country over the

20th Century. What is still the most canonical film history in German
(Jacobsen et al.), has chapters on German film history up to 1918 (the
imperial period), on Weimar film culture (1919-33), on Nazi film (1933-45),
on postwar cinema divided between East and West and, in the case of the
Federal Republic, further subdivided according to decades (1945-89), and,
in the second edition, it also contains a final chapter on post-Wall cinema
1
(1989 to present). Of course, these political breaks are important and I
am certainly not denying the impact of political transformations and system
change on the cinema sector in general and filmmaking specifically. At the
same time, there are other temporal markers in existence which are often
connected to the development of film as a medium that do not map exactly
onto these political dates, but are in conflict with them. The most significant
film-historical events that would imply a different periodization compared
to the major political ruptures are probably the following: the introduction
of the long feature film which happened in the early to mid-1910s during
the imperial period and before World War I; sound film was introduced
in Weimar Germany between 1928 and 1930; cinema attendance peaked in
the mid-1950s and then declined until the 1980s, a period in which the
competition with television provided the constant background noise. These
decisive moments could also be applied to divide German film history into
2
temporal slices. It is therefore a conceptual decision to give the (legal) takeover of government by the National Socialists in early 1933 more weight
than the introduction of sound a couple of years before. We are certainly not
arguing that sound film is more important (for film history) than the Nazis
coming to power, we simply want to highlight the unspoken assumptions
inherent in such periodization that are only seldomly discussed. Turning
to a data-driven approach, one can test the existing assumptions such as
the correlation (or even causal link) of cinema and political history which
undergirds much writing on German film history. In the analysis that follows
we wish to open up another perspective on this problem of periodization by
looking at the data of film production, more specifically of collaboration.

Films and/as networks
Film history is always a phenomenon of the in-between, of the
relation and of the context.
Lorenz Engell (10)

1 To be fair, one should add that these chapters following the political logic of German history are complemented by texts on experimental

and documentary film, on feminism and censorship, on criticism and the relationship of film to television that cut across the periodization.
2 In fact, US film history is more often conceptualized by dates relevant to the medium; the introduction of sound in the late 1920s is usually

seen as an epochal break, just as the Paramount decision by the Supreme court, forcing the studios in the late 1940s to divest themselves off
their cinema chains, thereby effectively ending vertical integration. See for an early example (Altman), and for a more current one, the
History of the American Cinema-series (University of California Press) which follows a film historical periodisation until the introduction of
sound (the volumes are divided as follows: up to 1907; 1907-1915; 1915-1928; 1926-1931), then turns to decades as the organizing principle.

Approaching a National Film History through Data. Network Analysis in German Film History

Film is a cultural form that is, in most cases, created in collectives (Mayer
et al.). Films are usually made in creative networks of individual actors
(Jones), some of whom are considered to be creative individuals (so called
“above the line”-workers or head of departments), while others are rather
3
seen as craftspeople, service providers or subworkers (“below the line”). Even
though the director is most often credited with being the author of a specific
4
work , most experts would agree that there is usually a group of creative
professionals involved in the making of a film. If a film has a shared vision
and is perceived to be of a piece, the creative individuals need to work closely
together because cultural objects cannot be produced on the drawing board,
but they need to be individualized and created collectively. By concentrating
on these collaborative networks, we are putting an emphasis on relationships,
not on individuals or singular works. Historically, the production of films has
been most frequently organized as freelance work in project teams. Factory5
like division of labour has played a role both in mainstream filmmaking as
well in other forms of film production (e.g. commissioned and educational
films), while non-collective, artisanal filmmaking by individuals proved to be
an alternative for experimental filmmakers, but the most common form of
organization remains the project team that is assembled for each production
anew. Even though teams are regrouped with each new film, the composition
of such teams is not arbitrary, but often professionals work in relatively stable
networks of co-workers. In a network analysis of film production in Hungary,
Juhász et al. have shown how the positioning in networks can be decisive for
success, measured in terms of awards won (Juhász et al.). Our take is to follow
a specific aspect of this approach, namely seeing the shifting networks of
collaboration as central to the workings of the industry. The approach in this
essay is to look at the key creatives involved in the production of a film: the
heads of departments and the main actors/actresses. We decided to specifically
extract the data for director, producer, screenwriter, director of photography,
editing, set design, and music, plus six actors/actresses. With the view towards
the selection of the material, the aim of this study is to consider the whole
field in a comprehensive way, not just the famous examples. This does not
necessarily produce better or more valuable results, but such research on the
basis of larger and comprehensive data sets might highlight aspects that have
gone unnoticed so far.

Data preparation
…the translation of the social into data involves a process of
abstraction that compels certain compromises to be made as the
data are generated, selected and analysed

This being an exploratory study, the time period – and therefore the data
pool – had to be limited, even though the amount of data we worked on
remained rather large when compared to many other network analyses in
6
the field of Digital Humanities. Initially, we wanted to concentrate on the
time period from 1919 to 1962 which would have encompassed a number of
different political systems. This time frame would have included the cinema
of the Weimar Republic and the reign of the Nazis, as well as the immediate
post-war period up to the Oberhausen Manifest (in February 1962) in the
West which ushered in the Young German Film (and therefore another period
in film history) and the building of the Berlin wall (August 1961) in the
East, thus anchoring for both East and West Germany the time frame with
historical events. Of course, such temporal boundaries are always to a certain
extent arbitrary, yet our aim was to have a number of ruptures within the
examined period and not to claim any primacy or specific significance for
this particular periodisation. When preparing the data though, we realized
that the amount of data would not only have taken a lot more time to
process than anticipated, but also given us so much material that we would
be overwhelmed. So, for the purpose of this article, we limited the time frame
to the 21-year-period from 1919 to 1939, concentrating on the immediate
interwar period. This choice encompasses the transition to sound, but not the
shift to the long feature film in the mid 1910s or the peak in cinema going in
the 1950s.
We used the data available and curated at Filmportal, the central internet
platform on German film, a non-profit project run by the German Film
Institute in Frankfurt and financed by national as well as regional cultural
funding. The service has been online since 2005 and arguably provides the
best data, in terms of credits and technical information, publicly available on
7
German cinema from the beginning to today. As a way to limit the amount
of data and to make it processable, we decided to concentrate on feature
films; therefore, short subjects, documentaries, “useful cinema” (Acland and
Wasson), such as films that are being shown in schools, universities,
administrations or companies, amateur films and others were excluded. For
each film we collected the following data: director, producer, writer, director
of photography, editor, production designer, and composer, as well as six
actors/actresses (those with top billing). There is no widespread consensus on
what the key contributors in terms of creative input are to a film production.
Jan-Christopher Horak, for example, has argued that exile films are films
made outside Germany by émigres who were working in the German-

speaking film industry prior to their migration; and he defined the key
position as director, writer and producer. We deliberately chose a more
encompassing model of creative work which included the main crafts
involved in the production of a film. Of course, decisions what to include
and what to exclude are to a certain extent always arbitrary. Why did we
not include sound design, make-up or costume? There are two reasons for
the exclusion of additional categories: First of all, we can find data for most
of the films for the creative positions chosen, while other crafts are often
not listed. This fact already demonstrates a certain contemporary significance.
Secondly, our aim was to show networks of people working together over
time and how these networks shift or remain stable. In order to do that, we
had to construct a data model and apply it which is necessarily an abstraction
from historical reality. Adding a category or two would not have changed the
results in decisive ways.
8

We created a unimodal network based on persons which were conceptualised
as nodes and on films which connected two persons (edge) that worked
on the same film. In our case, we wanted to understand temporal change
within the network and therefore we built a separate network for each
year. In effect, we ended up with 21 networks which we compared and
contrasted in different ways. In these networks, persons were conceptualized
as nodes, whereas connections are established if they work together on a
film. As a result, a film would usually create thirteen connections (direction,
production, screenwriting, camera, editing, set design, music, six actors/
actresses), sometimes more if the technical positions were occupied by more
than one person, sometimes less if not all of the positions were known or
occupied. We worked with CSV-files to process the data and used Gephi,
a popular and well-known program, as a tool to calculate the metrics and
visualize the networks. Once the dataset was cleaned and corrected, it
contained a total of 22.132 nodes, that is persons with credits in the relevant
categories, and 6.046 films over the 21-year-period. Since many persons show
up more than once in the same or in subsequent years, we counted 8.101
unique professionals that worked in the relevant categories on German films
between 1919 and 1939. Which information does this network actually
contain? It provides a certain image of the industry, as it shows how much
in demand professionals were that worked in creative positions on film. What
flows in these networks is reputation and the dynamics of the industry.
More importantly, the structure of the network also shows patterns of
collaboration. As the following observations will be concerned with the
density and centrality within the network and with changes over time,
the specific focus is on closeness and distance, on collaboration and
transformation.

8 A unimodal network only contains one kind of node and one kind of edge without further specification or direction of the edge. For the

possibilities and risks inherent in networks in the humanities see Weingart which has been important for our reasoning here.

Results
One of the first things we noticed already during the preparation of the data
was the rather wide fluctuation in the number of films produced in each year
(see fig. 1). In the beginning of the period under consideration, nearly 1000
films were made in a single year (1919: 866; 1920: 980; 1921: 717). There
are a number of reasons one can find for this phenomenon, among them the
fluctuating economy which made a highly speculative industrial sector such
as film production attractive to potential investors, as well as the weakness
of the currency which made exports very profitable and therefore potential
earnings higher (Spiker). Most important were probably the expectations
towards films (in terms of return on investment) and the generally low degree
of professionalization of the industry – it was relatively easy to enter the
industry which would also explain the rather high oscillation of the key
creative professionals involved in the production (see next paragraph). As
the years went on, it became costlier to make a film and it required more
expertise to enter the industry, so fewer films were made and more stability
was achieved. The number of films produced annually soon settled at a much
lower average of 230 films (calculated over the years 1923 to 1929) and even
lower, if we look at the sound film period with 154 films produced annually
(the average of the years 1930 to 1939). Given the capital necessary for film
production, the rising production costs and the access to professionals and
equipment, this development is not surprising. At least the number of films
produced annually was a parameter well known before (Prinzler).
We were specifically interested in the stability of the network (as a whole)
over time, so we tried to zoom in a bit on those persons that leave the
network from one year to the next. The first thing that struck us – even
Journal of Cultural Analytics

7

Approaching a National Film History through Data. Network Analysis in German Film History

though it did not quite surprise us – was that those people had a much lower
9
average participation in productions than those that stayed in the network.
Those that left the network from one year to another were involved in 1,3
to 1,6 productions in the preceding year, with 1,44 as the average. These
numbers remained rather stable over the whole period under investigation.
Since 1,0 is the lowest possible value here (because the person has to have
at least one credit in the preceding year), an average of 1,3 to 1,6 is pretty
low, especially if we look at the numbers for those remaining in the network.
The number of productions that the people remaining in the network from
one year to the next participated in fluctuated between 4,96 (nearly five
productions on average; in 1921) and 2,33 (in 1938) with the average of the
whole time period (1919-39) being 3,3. Of course, with the huge difference
in the number of films produced each year, it is only logical that these
number decline over time. For the 1920s, the average is 3,7 films, while for
the 1930s it is 2,9, echoing the general trend of fewer films produced per
year. Most probably, this also has to do with the average production time that
an individual was occupied with on any project. Films at the beginning of
the 1920s, on average, were produced faster and also with fewer participants.
Here, an approach based on network analysis is productive because it shows
wider trends based on the entirety of available data, not just a section or part
thereof.
The next thing we noticed was the rather wide fluctuation of personnel each
year. Each person that receives a credit in a given year is represented by a node;
one to two thirds of all the nodes of a given year (i.e. persons) do not show
up in the network of the next year. The highest numbers of people leaving
the network (not being present in the following year) are to be found in the
early years of the Weimar Republic. In the early 1920s about two thirds of the
professionals active in a given year did not receive a credit on a feature film in
the following year (1921: 66,3%; 1922: 68,5%; 1923: 64,3%), so it seems that
the industry was at a most volatile state. When looking more closely – and
beyond the immediate post-war situation – at the data, we noticed that one of
the largest percentage of people not showing up the next year in credits can be
observed from 1933 to 1934 (60,3%), i.e. exactly at the point in time, when –
after the National socialists came to power – a great number of professionals
belonging to persecuted groups (Jews, political activists, open opponents of
the fascists, queers and other minoritarian groups) were forced out of the film
industry. If we ignore the early years of the Weimar Republic as a short spell
of turmoil and disorder, then the percentage of persons not showing up in
next year’s credits is usually below 50%. It is only twice decisively over 55% in 1927 and in 1934. The peak in 1927 is harder to explain than the one in

9 Mainly for reasons of operationalization, we only looked at participation from year to year. We did not take into account that some

professionals do not show up one year and then have a credit again in the year after. Of course, one could model the data in such a way that
participation in the network has a half-life period of more than one year. Yet again, this being an exploratory study, we were more interested
in getting to know and exploring the data than in modelling only one particular question.

1934, but it could be due to the economic slump which hit the film industry
in 1926 (Kremeier 146–57), a kind of delayed reaction to the economic
crisis and inflation of 1923. The overall development becomes more apparent
when one calculates and works with a three-year-rolling average to account
for the time it takes from the conception of a project via the production
to the film coming into cinemas. Films usually take a year or two along
this path, so using a three-year average is an attempt to take vagaries of film
production into account. Here, a clear second climax (beside the one in the
post-World War One period) is visible in the years 1933 and 1934 which
clearly demarcates that the exodus from the German film industry is a result
of the Nazis coming to power, as some professionals were anticipating the
political changeover, while the trend intensified in 1933 and the following
years.
One of the most striking results is the noticeable increase in network density
over time. Network density is measured as the ratio between the potential and
the actual edges (connections) in the network. A network density of one (1,0)
would indicate that the full potential is realized, i.e. every node is connected
to all other nodes. Translated to our case at hand, such a state would indicate
that every person (node) in the network would work on every production.
The lower the network density, the more spread out is the participation in
films among the creative personnel. Or, put differently – a higher number
in network density indicates a smaller group working on more productions,
thus a more tightly knit group of creative professionals. The lowest density of

the network as a whole, thus also the highest average path length , is visible in
the early years of the Weimar republic (1919: 0,011; 1920: 0,010; 1921: 0,012;
1922: 0,014; 1923: 0,015). The value then increases noticeably and remains
rather close to 0,030 throughout the whole period under investigation. The
development of the average path length which stays clearly above 3 until 1925
and then oscillates around 2,7 for the rest of the period appears structurally
to be very similar. As time goes on, therefore, the network is structured more
densely, the industry is increasingly tightly knit, but it remains rather stable
in this respect all through the period under investigation.
These findings about the development of the network are corrobated by
the results in network diameter which show a similar development and
echo the findings just mentioned. The diameter is the longest chain in the
whole network that you are forced to travel along to get from one node
to another or, simply put, the longest distance between any two nodes. As
a measurement, it indicates how densely interconnected the nodes are or,
conversely, how spread out or loose the network is. Whereas the early years
of Weimar filmmaking (1919-23) shows a diameter of between 7 and 9, this
measurement later settles between 5 and 6. Superficially, this means that the
two persons furthest apart in the network, i.e. film industry, have to traverse
less nodes/people in later years. Yet again, the significance of the results goes
beyond the degree of separation of the film industry, as it illustrates a higher
degree of concentration in the industry. This concentration is indicative of
the interpersonal, but also of the economic state of the industry which tends
in the 1920s towards concentration (see also Spiker 34ff). Moreover, these
findings cannot simply be put down to the higher number of films being
produced in the early years: In 1923, when 254 films are being made, the
diameter of the network is seven, whereas in 1927 more films are made (267)
and the diameter is noticeably smaller (five). The stability – and above all,
the connectivity – that is achieved in 1924, after the inflation and the crash
of the economy, shows how this sector had settled on a relatively stable base
from which it then operated. This is maybe one of the key findings: despite a
rather large fluctuation of personnel (see above), the industry had achieved a
measure of structural stability by the mid-1920s which remained intact until
the late 1930s. Yet again, despite this structural consolidation, a rather large
number of professionals were forced out of the industry around the National
socialist take-over of power in 1933.
Another important measure in networks is the so called “Eigenvector
centrality” which calculates the centrality of specific nodes by looking at
neighboring nodes. A high score in Eigenvector centrality indicates that a
node is connected to numerous nodes which have high values (and therefore
also many connections to other high-scoring nodes). One of the most famous

cases of Eigenvector centrality is the Google PageRank which calculates the
11
value of web pages by looking at the incoming links. In our case, value
flows in both directions, as highly sought after professionals bestow value
to a production, but being part of an important film (with other respected
professionals) also increases the prestige of a person. Therefore, our edges
were undirected (not distinguishing between incoming and outgoing links).
The results are meaningful for calculating the real and symbolic value of
film workers that connect with others and therefore have a more central
position in the network. First of all, we specifically looked at the Eigenvector
centrality of those people that fell out of the network from one year to
another to find out how centrally they were positioned in the network. In
the first years, when the industry was highly volatile, the value was around

(0,137 for 1920; 0,177 for 1921; 0,144 for 1922 ). People remaining in the
film business had a much higher involvement in the industry (number of
productions they were involved in), roughly by the factor of three. The issue
at hand here is the structural composition of the industry; being marginal to

could score high just by linking to central pages without anyone noticing it.
12 We could not calculate the value for 1919 because we did not have the data for 1918 which would have been necessary to ascertain who

remained and who left the network.

the network (i.e. having a lower Eigenvector centrality) significantly increases
the likelihood of not working again on any film in the following year. From
1923 until the early 1930s, the Eigenvector Centrality of the people dropping
out of the network fluctuates between 0,07 and 0,1, while the Eigenvector
Centrality of the ones that stay in the network moves slightly up and down
around 2,0. A marked increase in Eigenvector Centrality of those falling out
of the network can be noticed in 1934, when it jumps to 0,112, indicating
that more people that were central to the network in the year before do not
show up anymore. Of course, we see here again the direct result of the Nazi
purges in the film sector after 1933, as up to 2000 people (Horak 101) had
to leave the industry.
Yet again, Eigenvector Centrality seems to be on a steady increase all through
the period in focus. If we take five year averages for those leaving the
network and those remaining we get 0,063 and 0,173 (1920-24), 0,072 and
0,185 (1925-29), 0,091 and 0,222 (1930-34), 0,123 and 0,266 (1935-39).
The measurement roughly doubles over the twenty years, both for those
remaining within the network, as well as for those leaving the network.
What remains stable is the relation between those not being employed in
the following year and those finding employment again (the factor oscillates
between 3 and 2,5). The increase confirms the observation that the industry is
getting more tight and more intensely connected over the years, but the ratio
of openness (new people entering the industry, established people leaving the
industry) to closeness (hiring always established experts) remains rather stable.
One hypothesis might be that a creative industry such as filmmaking requires
a certain relation between openness (hiring new and unknown people) and
closure (relying on tested professionals).

Approaching a National Film History through Data. Network Analysis in German Film History

Finally, we wanted to zoom in, so we examined in more detail some
individuals and their development over time. Eigenvector Centrality appeared
to us as the most important measurement of centrality in our network,
therefore we looked at the ten most highly ranked nodes (individuals) in each
year. Of course, centrality correlates to a certain degree with productivity –
with more productions, a node has more edges and therefore it becomes more
likely that the position is more central. Being engaged in many productions
implies that a person is sought after and thus occupies a position of centrality.
The top ten for each year gives us a list of those individuals with the highest
scores in Eigenvector Centrality in the network, i.e. the strongest neighboring
nodes. In these lists, actors and actresses dominate at first almost exclusively,
in the period 1919-24 they make up 72,5% of the list. By the mid-1920s
composers show up in surprising numbers (in the half-decade from 1925-29
they even form the biggest group in the list with 38%), probably due to the
fact that they are now permanently employed by big production companies
to write sheet music for the cinemas. This task can be done relatively quickly,
so that the composers can work on many different productions in one year
which gives them a lot of connections. In the five years after the introduction
of sound (1930-34), they make up 18% and then drop back to 4% in the
years leading up to World War Two (1935-39), a decline that is not so easily
explained. Directors and producers show up only very seldomly in these lists,
as they are usually occupied for longer periods of time with one project. A
lower overall number of credits means less connected nodes and therefore less
potential to be in direct vicinity to high-scoring nodes.
In 1930, no actor/actress is in the list (the only year in the whole period
in which acting personnel is absent from the top ten-list), but a number
of three screenwriters, the highest number in the whole time period under
investigation. Most likely, sound film increased the significance of the writing
(i.e. the dialogue), so they occupy about 10% of the positions in the list
after 1930, whereas before they were far less significant. This could be seen
as an indication that indeed the filmhistorical transition to sound film is a
significant turning point for the structure of the film industry. The central
role of cinematography and set design in German filmmaking which has been
discussed repeatedly in existing scholarship (Esser; Betz et al.; Bartels; Block)
can be seen by the relatively steady presence of cameramen and set designers
all through the period – each group usually makes up around 10%. In the
half-decade 1935-39 this number even increases to 22% for set design and
to 14% for cinematography. On the other hand, editing is completely absent
from this list; no editor makes the top ten in these 21 years. This would
indeed also corrobate existing scholarship in which editing has not played a
major role so far.

Conclusion
This has been an exploratory study which investigates the use value of
network analysis as a method for conceptualizing collaboration and
connectivity in a (national) film culture. While network analysis has been
used as a tool in many fields of the humanities (Barabási; Ahnert et al.) it is
rather new to film studies. With this methodological adoption, the present
study does not claim to offer a better approach or the ultimate solution to
an old problem, but it rather proposes to use the data and digital methods
at our disposal for an alternative look at some of the issues that film history
has grappled with in the past. At the same time, this study also wants to
contribute to answering the question of what new insights might become
possible through the systematic application of network research methods in a
specific field.

Approaching a National Film History through Data. Network Analysis in German Film History

In film history, the focus has traditionally been on single-work analyses and
relatively stable categories such as author, national cinema, or genre, which
have been examined according to established methods. Shifting the focus to
network research means to open up a different perspective. This transition
from fixed entities to linkages which network research necessitates stresses
relationality and relativity. Since nodes and edges are mutually dependent,
the primacy of objects as fixed entities no longer applies; rather, changing
relations provide for constant repositioning within a wider web of references.
Thus, instead of being viewed in isolation as a monument, a network-based
approach emphasizes the embeddedness and interconnectedness of entities
such as films or filmmakers. This allows new perspectives on structures or
influences to be derived, and possibilities and limits of agency are once again
configured differently than in many conventional studies because networks
of relationships become the focus of attention. The dynamic nature of
networks, especially when read historically on a temporal axis, requires an
approach that is interested in the constitution of groups and their always
fuzzy boundaries (because social groups always include connections beyond
the internal structure).
We do not use data to test a fixed and stable hypothesis which are then either
confirmed or falsified (as, for example, clinical studies do). We rather follow
the lead of “exploratory data analysis” (Tukey; Arnold and Tilton 50ff), as
data and hypotheses stand in a relation of mutual interconnectedness. We
look at data in order to verify or falsify hypotheses, but data also often
give rise to new hypotheses; as we find trends and outliers that we did not
notice before. Thus, we need to take the mutual interdependence of data
and hypotheses into account. In this respect, we have to constantly remind
ourselves that data is always modelled, as it is an abstraction from reality. Yet
again, modelling also happens in approaches that study a specific national
cinema through a small number of films, as the sample implicitly claims that
it is representative of the larger whole.
The engagement with subject-specific research data as well as the consistent
acquisition and application of data skills enables the opening up of new
perspectives in film studies. In particular, the innovative use of collected data
resources in relation to existing and new research questions supports a recontouring of the field. Using data-based methods, comparative studies can
be carried out, because previously unpublished or unnoticed data holdings on
the history of cinema are made accessible and used consistently for the first
time. In this way, questions that have already been asked frequently come into
view in such a way that they can open up data-based paths to other insights
- and especially to new models of thought. This is by no means to say that
the large amounts of available data - “big data” in the sense of the Californian
ideology - finally enable us to find better or even true answers, but rather
that it is about the productivity of a new perspective that is able to frame
certain questions differently. Among the questions to be answered in such
