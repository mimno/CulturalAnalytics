This paper focuses on exploring the differences in inquiries made by men and
women within a religious context. Additionally, we aim to ascertain whether it’s
feasible to forecast the popularity of answers and the factors contributing to
their popularity. To achieve this, we compile a new dataset comprising 40,000
question-answer pairs categorized by gender and popularity. These are sourced
from online question-and-answer platforms. Our methodology involves
comprehensive experimental analysis, utilizing advanced Arabic text
preprocessing alongside machine learning algorithms. We concentrate on two
primary objectives: predicting the gender of the questioner and forecasting the
popularity of answers. Furthermore, we delve into thematic variations based on
gender and address pivotal research queries that offer new perspectives within
this domain. These include investigating the differences between questions
posed by women versus men, exploring the potential for automated
classification of queries by gender, predicting the popularity of fatwas, and
identifying the contributing factors to their popularity. Our experimental
findings demonstrate a 98% accuracy in gender prediction, precise predictions
of popularity with minimal margin for error, and the identification of topics
and their associations that are more inclined towards either men or women. We
intend to share both the dataset and the source code openly with the research
community.

1. Background and Introduction
Research on Muslim women has recently grown rapidly (Faiz et al.; Khan
and Mollah; Kloos and Ismah). This may be due to shifting attention after
women in the industrialized world gained considerable rights (Maftuhin;
READ and BARTKOWSKI; Nikjoo et al.; Baboolal; Murrar et al.; Abu-Ras
and Itzhaki-Braun). Most prominent among the issues of Muslim women
are how (and why) Muslim women wear the hijab (Abu-Lughod; Acker;
Brenner) and Muslim women’s political participation (Finlay and Hopkins;
Akbarzadeh and Roose; Bhimji). A recent study of Islam in the English
Wikipedia has found that the tenth most salient collocate of the adjectives
Muslim/Islamic is the noun woman, ahead of such common collocates as
conquest, jurisprudence, state, art, philosophy, terrorism, fundamentalism,
and even prophet (Mohamed), but it remains true that “studies on Muslim
women’s online activities remain few and far between” (Piela). Most of
these studies focus on Muslim women’s online activism and include their

Exploring Gender Differences in Fatwa through Machine Learning

attempts to challenge male dominance. Alexandros Sakellariou (Sakellariou)
used discourse analysis tools to examine female Greek converts to Islam
in their digital presence, using their conversion stories as a means of
understanding their social milieu as well as their digital and non-digital
identities. Rahman, Fung, and Yeo used a small corpus of 1480 online
comments to study Canadian attitudes towards the Hijab (the Muslim
women’s headscarf). The authors made use of computational tools, namely
sentiment analysis, as well as content analysis for their investigation (Rahman
et al.). One common trait of these studies is that they used small samples and
focused on specific issues(Al-Ghadir et al.; Al-Ghadir and Azmi; Al-Sarem
and Emara).
In this paper, we introduce a new dataset containing 172,000 questionanswer pairs written in Arabic from a religious question-answering platform
and show its usefulness to answer important questions such as what are
the differences between questions posed by men and women, what makes
an answer popular? The answers to such questions add new insights to the
existing knowledge in fields of social sciences, cultural analytics, personal law,
economics, technology, education, medicine, religious studies, information
retrieval, or digital text forensics. Although we limit our investigation to the
aforementioned questions, the novel dataset introduced in this paper can
be used for a variety of purposes including (1) studying linguistic gender
variation since the questions are marked for the gender of the questioner,
(2) tracking a specific issue as the questions span 17 years, (3) tracking the
rise and fall of specific themes, thanks to the view numbers associated with
different dates, (4) Natural Language Processing tasks like summarisation and
document similarity in a religious domain, and (5) tracking authority shift in
the Muslim world.
Islamic Question Answering sites such as IslamWeb is similar to other
community question-answering platforms by not only allowing people to
post a wide variety of questions but also by offering qualified legal scholars
a chance to browse and answer any of them. Typically, in these services, new
questions can be formulated at any moment, and receive several responses
from different qualified legal scholars (Figueroa)
To describe our dataset we first need to illustrate the concept of Fatwa in
Islam. Britannica provides an accurate definition of fatwa (Fatwa):
" Fatwa, in Islam, is a formal ruling or interpretation on a point
of Islamic law given by a qualified legal scholar (known as a
mufti). Fatwas are usually issued in response to questions from
individuals or Islamic courts. Though considered authoritative,
fatwas are generally not treated as binding judgments; a
requester who finds a fatwa unconvincing is permitted to seek
another opinion. "

Exploring Gender Differences in Fatwa through Machine Learning

While usually directed to scholars of Islam, fatwas span a wide range of topics
including politics, financial matters, family problems, and even medical issues,
among many others (Agrama; Ismail and Baharuddin; Dahlan et al.; Adel and
Numan). Traditionally, fatwas were issued by institutions and institutional
scholars, but now most fatwas are issued online, either by individual scholars
or on web portals belonging to religious institutions. Two main websites
(fatwa portals) dominate the fatwa market:
• IslamWeb is a comprehensive website with fatwas, articles, videos,
and many other features for Muslims. According to SimilarWeb,
it ranks 3,927 globally and is visited by 20.23 million viewers a
day with the top countries being Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Algeria,
Morocco, and France. The website is owned by the Qatari Ministry
of Religious Affairs. It is worth investigating why this website is so
popular among Muslims from so many Muslim countries through
social science research methods. This study is beyond the scope of
this article.
• Islam Questions and Answers has a global rank of 6,181 and has
13.66 million daily visits. The website was founded and run by
the Syrian/Saudi scholar Muhammad Salih Al-Munajjid. The top
countries visiting IslamQA are Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United
1
States, the United Kingdom, and the United Arab Emirates.
We attribute the popularity of these websites partially to the fact that they
handle many questions as they answer around 200 questions every day
and publish sensitive material while maintaining questioner anonymity. The
anonymity guarantees that questioners can experiment freely, talk about
their mistakes without being embarrassed, address wrongs without facing the
consequences, and be judged based on the presented facts and not on external
information (Jordan). A full investigation of the factors, social and otherwise,
that belie the popularity of these websites is worthy of future research.
Fatwas raises many questions that experts in Islamic Studies and the sociology
of Islam may find interesting. Our newly created dataset should thus be of
interest to these scholars and others in computational humanities, digital
humanities, computational linguistics, and computational social science.
Research Questions: In this paper, we present a new massive dataset and the
transformations it went through. In addition, we showcase the usefulness of
the dataset in answering three pertinent questions, which add new insights to
the existing knowledge:

regularly, so the readers may not get the exact numbers reported here.

1. What, if any, are the differences between the questions posed by
women and those asked by men?
2. Can we automatically classify the questions as either male or female?
3. Can we predict fatwa popularity? And what makes a fatwa popular?
The questions follow a logical sequence in which question one focuses on
examining existing gendered data, question two applies classification when
no gender labels exist, thus discovering more questions asked by women and
men, and question three assigns a measure of importance to the questions
to which gender has been assigned. The questions thus seek to maximize
the benefits of this dataset to the researchers in the fields of Islamic studies,
women’s studies, and gender studies.
The rest of this paper goes as follows: in section 2, we describe the dataset;
in section 3 we describe preprocessing and the methods we use to answer the
questions; in section 4 we present the results with a discussion of important
issues; and in section 5, we conclude the study and outline some future
research.

2. Dataset
The data used in this study is extracted from the fatwa portal Islam Web,
which is one of the largest fatwa portals online. According to the SimilarWeb,
IslamWeb has 17.97M daily visits, with a global rank of 3,897, and it ranks
first in the category of Community and Society > Faith and Beliefs. Islam
Web publishes 200 fatwas a day on average on a variety of topics with
questions coming from around the world, but the portal does not publish
any demographic data, which makes it hard to sort the questions and the
answers based on the gender of the questioner. Since gender is one of
the major demographic indicators and is of main interest to the authors,
we have utilized the morphological nature of Arabic in search of gendered
linguistic inflexion. Fortunately, Arabic, the main language of Islam Web,
is a morphologically rich language inflected for gender, so in some cases,
when the questioner speaks in a personal way, or when the scholar addresses
the questioner personally, it becomes possible to identify the gender of the
questioner. We use linguistic cues to extract the gender-identifiable fatwas
from the fatwa collection.

2.1. Linguistic cues for gender identification
With Arabic being a grammatical gender language, speakers use gendered
pronouns, nouns, verbs, and adjectives to refer to themselves and others. The
word for doctor in Arabic is either tabib (male doctor) or tabiba (female
doctor), so if a question has the expression ana tabib, this indicates the
questioner is male. We also use the answers for the same purpose. kama

Journal of Cultural Analytics

Exploring Gender Differences in Fatwa through Machine Learning

ta’alm means as you (male) know, while the female version is kama ta’lamin.
We use these linguistic cues to assign gender to questions. We have a four-step
approach as follows:
• starts with a seed list of gendered expressions, including pronouns,
nouns, adjectives, and verbs. The list also includes regular
expressions in the form I gendered_noun and you gendered_verb.
• extracts all the fatwas that are either male or female.
• check the intersection of the male and female fatwas and remove any
common fatwas from the sets
• examine five hundred fatwas manually to check how accurate the
method is.
After applying the four steps, we found 40458 with uncontested gender
information out of 172,000 fatwas. The manual checks found no incorrectly
assigned fatwas.

2.2. The resulting dataset
The resulting dataset comprises 40458 questions with 17221 asked by women
and 23237 asked by men. Questions vary considerably in length with the
average number of words per question at 116.83, with a standard deviation of
120.25, a median of 80, a minimum of 3, and a maximum of 3019. There are
differences between the lengths of questions by men and women. For men,
the average is 109.5 words (std = 117, min = 3, max = 3019, median = 74)
while for women the average is 126.79 (std = 123.9, min = 4, max = 2109,
median = 89). The dataset is distributed in a JSON streaming file with the
keys: question, answer, date indicating the date of publication, classification,
which is a coarse classification of the question provided by the website and
views, which is the number of times the fatwa has been viewed. The dataset
(40458 questions) has been randomly divided into a training set (85%, 34389
questions) and a test set (15%, 6069 questions). 10% of the training set has
also been dedicated as a development set. This division is the same across
all the experiments below. All the dataset metadata is available, directly or
indirectly in the html. In Figure 1, we have a screenshot of a recent fatwa with
numbers marking the different pieces of the annotation:

2.2.1. questions and answers
The dataset includes questions by the public and their answers by Muslim
scholars on various aspects of Islam. The average length of questions is 116.83
words, with a standard deviation of 120.25, a minimum of 3, and a maximum
of 3019 (and a median of 80). The average length of answers is 223.3, with a
std of 163.8, a min of 0, and a max of 5809 (median = 185). There does not
seem to be a strong correlation between question length and answer length as
the Pearson correlation is 0.21. In the current work, we use the questions and

the answers to predict both gender and views based on textual data, but the
questions and answers could be used to study various issues in Islamic studies
and the sociology of Islam. Linguistic gender variation is also a potential
research question that is made possible by this dataset.

2.2.2. titles
A title is usually a summary of the questions styled as a journalistic headline
and is meant to attract attention. Although we do not use titles in this paper,
mainly because they don’t have the gender cues and because their content is
included in the body of the Fatwa, they hold quite some potential as they can
be used in Natural Language Processing research for summarisation and title
generation. They can also be used in text similarity experiments and in short
text classification.

2.2.3. views
The website records the HTML hits each page receives. This is extremely
useful information for fatwa popularity as it could tell us how many people
are interested in this specific question, and with some abstraction, how
important the theme or category of the fatwa is. There is a strong, but not
perfect, correlation between the number of questions in a category and the
total number of views per category (Pearson r = 0.79).

Exploring Gender Differences in Fatwa through Machine Learning

The questions and answers in the gender-labeled data have been viewed
180,738,210 times, with an average of 4465 per question, but this is not
evenly distributed as the standard deviation is 10124.7, with a minimum of
12 and a maximum of 441706. The median is 2485, which indicates a rightskewed distribution. The 5 top-viewed questions in the corpus are about
prayer (441706 views), masturbation (432674), concubinage (318502), sexual
excitation and genital cleanliness (314662), and divorce (304675).
The counts above are based on the views as they were recorded on 8 February
2016, but the data also includes the views as recorded on 8 July 2020. The
2020 counts are available for only 34714 fatwas in the corpus since the
website deletes fatwas from time to time. It is not clear why the website
deletes some Fatwas. According to the 2020 counts, the 34714 fatwas have
been viewed 371,142,364 times, with an average of 10691 views per fatwa. We
use views in a regression experiment in which we try to predict the number of
views based on the textual content of the question. The purpose of prediction
is two-fold: (i) it is used in the regression model to explain the contribution of
each theme to the number of views, which helps rank those themes in terms
of importance, and (ii) the model can be used to predict how popular a new
question may become in future.

2.2.4. categories
Each fatwa is categorized according to a hierarchical set of labels. For example,
a question on whether it is Islamically legitimate to work on improving the
Arabic Wikipedia is assigned the label Main
Thought, Politics and
2
Art
Culture and Thought while a question from a young woman
complaining against her father who does not let her drive her own car is
3
classified as Main
Family Matters
Women’s Issues. These labels
are useful in obtaining a coarse-grained idea of the range of issues raised
on these platforms. This could be used in Natural Language Processing and
Machine Learning research for learning (hierarchical) classifications.

2.2.5. textual evidence
When the muftis provide answers, they usually support their answers with
textual evidence from the Qur’an, the Prophetic traditions, quotes by
prominent scholars, or scientific research. These could be useful in
understanding the sources governing Muslim thinking. They could also be
used in machine learning and digital humanities research for intertextuality
detection and text reuse.

Figure 2. Fatwa counts per year from 1999 to 2015

The resulting dataset, as shown in Figure 2 spans 17 years, from 1999 to
2015, with the number of views per fatwa available for February 2016 and
July 2020, which could be used for both tracking fatwa popularity through
time and regression analysis.

3. Methodology
To answer the first question: What, if any, are the differences between the
questions posed by women and those asked by men?, we use topic modelling
to find the themes of the questions raised by men and women and the odds
ratios to determine which themes are more female and which tend to be
more male. To answer the second question: Can we automatically classify the
questions as either male or female?, we use text classification, mainly through
automatic machine learning, and we also try to find which lexical items are
more associated with men and women. For the third question: Can we predict
fatwa popularity? and what makes a fatwa popular? , we use text regression
using two popular algorithms: linear regression and random forests regression
combined with topic modelling, which is used for explanation. As Arabic is a
morphologically rich language, we use stemming throughout.

3.1. Stemming
A white space-delimited unit in Arabic is usually made up of zero or more
prefixes, a lexical item, and zero or more suffixes. Common prefixes are
conjunctions, prepositions, and the definite article while common suffixes
are possessive and object pronouns. For example, the orthographic unit
fsykfykhm, depicted in Figure 3, is made up of the conjunction f, the future

Exploring Gender Differences in Fatwa through Machine Learning

maroon-coloured arrows.

particle s, the verb ykfy, the direct object k and the indirect object hm. The
verb itself is made up of the prefix n and the verb stem kfy. In most of what
we do in this paper, we are mostly concerned with the stem.
For stemming to happen, the text is first run through morphological
segmentation, which sets segment boundaries within words. The segments
are then passed through a part of the speech tagger that assigns grammatical
tags (e.g. NOUN, VERB, ADJECTIVE) to these segments. The stem is the
main lexical unit in the word and must have a lexical tag (NOUN, VERB,
ADJECTIVE). All other tags are discarded in the topic modeling experiments
while in lexical experiments they are retained since they are useful for style
differentiation. Stemming is achieved through the use of ArabicSOS, which is
specialized in segmentation, orthographic standardization, and stemming of
classical and religious Arabic (Mohamed and Sayyed). The stemming effect
on the dataset is dramatic as the number of words in the questions is 4729279
with 168827 unique words. The number of segments is 7868382 with 48553
unique segments. The unique segments are hardly 29% of the original unique
words.

3.2. Topic modeling
Topic modelling is a way of summarising text documents into collections of
thematically related words called topics. Due to the nature of Arabic, there
is a high type-token ratio as there are too many unique words, and running
topic modelling with this is not very useful. For this reason, we use the stems
as input to the topic modelling software. We use Mallet (McCallum) for

Journal of Cultural Analytics

9

Exploring Gender Differences in Fatwa through Machine Learning

running the topic modelling and we are interested in two Mallet outputs:
(1) the keys of the topics, or the lexical items constituting the topic, and (2)
the probabilities associated with the topics, especially the probability of each
topic in each document as we use these probabilities as input to the machine
learning classifiers below. For consistency in topic modelling, we use the same
50 topics for all the experiments below.

3.2.1. classification
For gender prediction, we use supervised machine learning (Sarwar and
Mohamed). There are two main settings in these classification experiments:
• text classification, in which the dependent variable is the gender
(male or female) and the predictive variables are made up of the
textual content of the fatwa. The textual content could be word
unigrams (each variable is a single word) or word bigrams (each
variable is either a unigram or a bigram. For example, in the
sentence: The sky is blue, the unigrams are [‘the’, ‘sky’, ‘is’, ‘blue’]
and the bigrams are [‘the sky’, ‘sky is’, ‘is blue’]. The values of these
variables will be the frequencies of these n-grams in each document.
We do not use raw frequency, but we use TFIDF (Term Frequency
Inverse Document Frequency), which computes the most distinctive
lexical items for each document and is thus more conducive to
accurate classification.
• topic classification, in which we use the output of topic modelling
for classification. When we run topic modelling, we obtain, for each
document in the corpus, the probabilities of each topic being in that
document. If we use 50 topics, then, for each document, we have 50
probabilities corresponding to the 50 topics. These probabilities can
then be used to predict the gender of the document. Refer to the
section below for results.

3.3. Regression
The purpose of regression is to predict, for each question, how popular the
question may be. Just like with classification, we use both the textual content
and the topics for regression. In both regression and classification, we use
a variety of algorithms that will be detailed below. For both regression and
classification, we use 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing. We
mainly use the scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al.; Mohamed and Sarwar) library,
which has a wide range of algorithms.

4. Discussion of Results and Implications
In this section, we discuss the results of our experimental studies and their
implications. Recall that, in this paper, we present a new massive dataset and
the transformations it went through. In addition, we showcase the usefulness
of the dataset in answering three pertinent questions, which add new insights
to the existing knowledge.

4.1. Answer to Question 1
What, if any, are the differences between the questions posed by women and
those asked by men?
In order to find out what the differences may be between the questions
asked by women and those asked by men, we use topic modelling. We then
use Odds Ratios (see Tables 3 and 4) to find out which topics are more
correlated with men and which are more characteristic of women. Table 1
lists the 50 topics produced by Mallet ordered by their odds ratios. Since
female-centric questions were assigned the zero class, odds ratios less than one
are more associated with women while odds ratios larger than one are more
characteristic of male-centric questions.
We can see from the table that there are clear differences between the
questions asked by women and those raised by men. The top concern for
women in this dataset is family matters (children, marriage, divorce). We
can also see religious ritual questions concerning menstruation and fasting
as menstruating women do not have to observe the obligatory fasting in
the lunar Islamic month of Ramadan. The current study focuses on a
convenience sample of Muslim men and women who are mostly in the
Middle East, and the results may thus be hard to generalize. The interest in
the family may echo women’s interests in other cultures as well. A study that
examined a corpus of happiness moments found out that women and men
have different sources of well-being (Mohamed and Mostafa), as men’s top
source of happiness was related to games and sports while women’s was more
related to family and shopping.
While differences between Men and Women may not be news in general,
the details of these differences within the religious domain are of interest.
For example, Men seem to be interested in totally different things, such
as ensuring that the job or work they have is conformant to the rules of
Islam, working and residing in other countries, especially Western countries,
and obtaining their residences and citizenship, marriage and divorce
consequences, the differences among scholars of Islam, life, death, and the
hereafter, the relationships between Muslims and non-Muslims, banking
and usury, especially concerning getting a bank loan and whether this is
permissible in Islam, trade and transactions and rules on how to make

but I do not feel like it. I do not use contraceptives, but his
addiction stands in the way. Am I committing a sin by not
seeking to get pregnant? Please reply quickly. I do not know
5
who else to ask. It’s been months, and I cannot find a solution.
The use of topic models also gives us the chance to examine which topics go
together. Figure 5 shows the relationships between the topics. To create this
network, we only considered the most probable topic pairs. To illustrate, let’s
examine topic 4, the most common topic in the questions asked by women.
When we have topic 4 as the most probable theme in a certain document,
topics 13 and 26 are the most probable second topics in that document, so
we connect them together. For topic 4, this results in the graph shown in
Figure 4. What this indicates is that if a question involves matters of problems
with their husband, family, children, and divorce, then it is also very likely to
mention that the husband hits the questioner, insults her in front of other
people, is mad at her and treats her badly (topic 13), and that this may come
in the context of a discussion about visiting family (Topic 26). Topic 4 is
also very likely to be invoked in the context of topic 44 (divorce anger return
home dispute), topic 38 (money salary haram amount expenses help), topic
49 (tradition problem talk people hope to return), and topic 17 (life problem
big family tries to leave).

4.2. Answer to Question 2: Predicting Gender
Can we automatically classify the questions as either male or female?
In our specific case, we want to predict the gender of the author of the
question even though we may use the answer as a means to this prediction.
If the answer is addressed to a female, based on the morphology, then it is
certain that the question was asked by a female. If the addressee is male then
the question was asked by a male. In the cases where the morphology does
not help identify the gender of the questioner, we do not use that specific
Fatwa in training the machine learning classifier.
We run several experiments to predict gender. In all cases, we use the Term
Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) for feature extraction and
an n-gram range of (1, 2), which means we use both individual words and
two consecutive words as features. we use three algorithms in this task:
Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines. As far
as the input text is concerned, we vary the input to be either the question
alone, the answer alone, or a combination of the answer and the question.
Table 2 lists the results of these experiments. Using both the questions and
answers as input with the Support Vector Machines algorithms yields the best
results with precision, recall, and an F1 score of 0.98, which is a very high
number, and means that we can predict the gender of the one who asked the
question with 98% score. Using topic probabilities in gender classification did
not yield good results, compared to lexical input, as the best result was an
score of 0.68 using Logistic Regression.

While logistic regression is not the best-performing prediction algorithm,
one major advantage of its use is its high interpretability. One can use the
coefficients of the features (i.e. the lexical items) to see which words are more
likely to be used by males and which are more often used by females. This
also applies to the words and phrases more commonly used by the muftis
when the questioner is male or female. This also helps with the possibility
of generalization. We have extracted 40,000 out of 170,000 fatwas based
on morphological clues. If these morphological clues distinguish male from
female fatwas, then the possibility of an accurate classifier that generalizes
beyond this small corpus is limited. If, on the other hand, the features
are not limited to the morphological cues then we can use the classifier to
predict much more than the small dataset. Examining the top 100 male lexical
features and their equivalent female ones shows that the classifier is capable
of generalization. The top 10 male features are not morphological.

4.3. Answer to question 3: fatwa popularity
Can we predict the popularity of a fatwa based on its content? To answer this
question, we perform text regression where the predictor variables are the
lexical items of the questions, and the response variable is the number of
views each question receives.
To perform the regression, we convert the text into vectors. We do so through
TFIDF as explained above. When we compute the number of views, we do
so based on the number of views per day. Since the fatwas appeared online on
different dates, it may not be fair to compare the raw views. This is the reason
we divide the number of views by the number of days a fatwa is online,
so we may obtain daily views. The daily views, rather than the raw ones,
are what we want to predict. As shown in Figure 2, the fatwa dates range
between 1999 and 2015, but the views were recorded in February 2016 and
July 2020. Since dates of publication are available for each fatwa, we subtract
the publication date from 8/7/2020, the days the fatwa was downloaded,
to obtain the number of days the fatwa was online. We then divide the
number of views by the number of days to obtain the views per day. The

views per day is the number we predict using the various regression models.
We use different algorithms and compare the results to see which one best
predicts the daily views per question. We also examine the feature ranking for
features that affect the regression model. In terms of evaluation, we evaluate
the regression model based on two things: (1) the
value and (2) how good
it is at predicting the views in a test set based on the Mean Absolute Error
(MAE). The
is a measure of goodness-of-fit and is usually interpreted as
how much variation is explained by the independent variables. An
of 0.6,
for example, indicates that 60% of the variation in the dependent variable can
be explained by the independent variables. The
is known to be sensitive to
the number of independent variables as it increases proportionally with the
increase in the number of independent variables. This is a problem in text
regression as the number of independent variables is very large, which may
lead to inflated
values. For this reason, we also use prediction to evaluate
the regression model. The MAE is a measure of the average distance between
the actual values and the values predicted by the model and can thus be useful
in comparing various models.
The results of regression, as shown in Table 5 indicate that when we use
a combination of word unigrams and bigrams, both linear regression and
Random Forests regression do a good job predicting views per day given the
question as input. Linear regression has an
of 0.99953, which is near
perfect but may also indicate over-fitting for the training data. The mean
absolute error is 5.62 on the test set. This is a good MAE given that the
standard deviation of the test set values is 9.55. Random Forests do an even
better job at prediction, probably due to their non-over-fitting, with an MAE
of 3.49. This indicates that predicting the views per day based on the textual
content is feasible. The experiments also show that segmentation does not
help as every whole-word experiment yields better results than its segmented

counterpart. We attribute this to the availability of data. With our large data
set, there is no need for segmentation, whose main purpose is to combat data
sparseness.
The Random Forests algorithm is superior to the linear regression one in
prediction. One other nice facet of RF is that it also produces a list of the
top features used in regression. Perhaps one should examine what features in
the input are responsible for these views. For this, we use the most important
features (lexical n-grams) as produced by the RF algorithm. An examination
of the top 100 features in the unigram +bigram model reveals that the
most important concepts that trigger views are related to sex, cleanliness, and
prayer. For example, the top 10 grams can be translated into: through the
condom, is foreplay permissible, caressing the, anal, condom, inserting part of,
intercourse, prayer, at the right time, masturbation, and orgasm.
Perhaps a more effective way for finding out popularity triggers is to find
what themes are more viewed. For this purpose, we use the probabilities of
the topics produced by topic modelling as features and the views per day
as the dependent variable, to rank the topics in terms of their importance
to the Random Forest regression algorithm. This ranking shows how much
each topic contributes to the number of views per day. Table 6 lists the
five most important topics, and we can see that questions about marriage
and engagement top the list. A common theme here is the problem of the
family refusing the prospective fiance(e), and the question is usually what
one should do in such a case. This is followed by the question of (premarital
and extra-marital) sexual activity and how one should repent. We then have
topics on cleanliness and prayer, fasting the month of Ramadan, and what
one should do if they miss days of required fasting, and then we have financial
questions most of which are about whether some financial transaction is halal
(permissible in Islam) or haram (impermissible according to Islamic law). The
prominence of sexual topics may be related to the fact that Islam is very
restrictive in terms of premarital sex (Adamczyk and Hayes).

5. Conclusion
In this paper, we have introduced a versatile dataset with textual content
and metadata that make it suitable for research in computational linguistics,
Islamic Studies, and Computational Social Science. We have also shown

Journal of Cultural Analytics

19

Exploring Gender Differences in Fatwa through Machine Learning

use case examples of the dataset about questions of thematic analysis, text
classification, and text regression. The dataset, with the use cases provided,
has great potential for further formal and content-based research.
We found that there are clear differences between the questions asked by
women and those raised by men. The top concern for women in this dataset
is family matters (children, marriage, divorce). We can also see religious ritual
questions concerning menstruation and fasting as menstruating women do
not have to observe the obligatory fasting in the lunar Islamic month of
Ramadan. We also examined the top 100 male lexical features and their
equivalent female ones to show that the classifier is capable of generalization.
The top 10 male features are not morphological. Our experimental findings
demonstrate a 98% accuracy in gender prediction, precise predictions of
popularity with minimal margin for error, and the identification of topics
and their associations that are more inclined towards either men or women.
In the future, we are planning to investigate further questions including: (1)
How do the muftis formulate their answers, and do they speak differently
to men and women? (2) What is the authority frame that the muftis use to
convince the reader of the soundness of their answers? and (3) What are the
linguistic differences between male and female-centric questions? The dataset
is ripe for investigation and we hope other researchers will find it useful for
their research.
