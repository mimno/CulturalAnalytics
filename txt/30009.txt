ABSTRACT
This article furthers ongoing work on the merits of the feminist novel’s intrinsic variability by
probing its dynamics in four publishing contexts: contemporary anglophone literary criticism,
prestigious review publications, marketing materials, and online book reviews by social readers.
We explore how these interpretive communities converge and diverge in their assessments of
feminist fiction over the past twenty-five years by evaluating articles from the MLA International
Bibliography, book reviews in The New York Times, The New Yorker, Times Literary Supplement, and other prominent periodicals, blurbs from Amazon, and Goodreads reviews. We trace
the feminist novel’s ambivalent fates—or rather, feminist novels’ ambivalent fates—in and
across these four domains. To do so, we engage computational methods of topic modeling, most
distinctive word analysis, and named entity recognition. We synthesize these quantitative results
with qualitative attention to provocative examples from our corpus. In so doing, we consider
how literary scholars can develop more robust understandings of what feminism and feminist
fiction mean to contemporary readers and what we stand to gain by bringing this diverse
interpretive labor into our scholarly conversations.
Our synthetic interpretive approach reveals these communities’ shared topical investments in
feminist fiction, though the communities talk about these topics in importantly different ways.
Together, their discourse converges on two organizing concerns: embodied subjectivity and
temporality. Different configurations of these aspects of personhood in time inform the
communities’ vocabularies, their modes of self-address, the rationales they offer for reading
feminist novels, and the forms of feminist subjectivity they promote. Our analysis thus
demonstrates how novel reading can function as a mode of forging feminist knowledge and
constructing feminist value systems: through imagined conversations with other readers,
individuals and the interpretive communities in which they participate undertake this additive,
pluralistic revisionary process with a connection to the past, a grounding in the present, and a
commitment to ever-better futures.

What do you hear when you hear the word feminism? It is a word that fills
me with hope, with energy. … It brings to mind books written, tattered and
worn, books that gave words to something, a feeling, a sense of an injustice,
books that, in giving us words, gave us the strength to go on. Feminism: how
we pick each other up. So much history in a word; so much it too has picked
up.
—Sara Ahmed, Living a Feminist Life (2017)1

Sara Ahmed’s Living a Feminist Life (2017) asserts feminism’s definitional
instability as its strength and locates this asset in a literary genealogy that
reciprocally influences feminism’s capacious, shapeshifting project.2 Participating
in a nascent scholarly trend, Ahmed argues that feminism does not comprise a
coherent set of beliefs, opinions, convictions, or political positions, but rather
reflects a shared imperative of asking difficult, ethically-minded questions without
holding out hope for a stable set of answers.3 This self-reflexive life project engages
literature as a formative object in part because it provides models of feminist value
systems—sometimes irreconcilable, sometimes harmonious, sometimes disappointing, but always operating as a spur to sharpen the reader’s own sense of what
it might mean to “live a feminist life.”
This recent attention to feminism’s definitional instability echoes a longer-standing
critical ambivalence about defining feminist literature and the feminist novel in
particular. Over the past four decades, scholars such as Nancy A. Walker and Rita
Felski have articulated this ambivalence largely obliquely, skirting definitions of
feminist fiction or avoiding ideological meanings by emphasizing literary elements
(e.g., female protagonists, realist aesthetics) and only gesturing to sociopolitical
implications.4 Ahmed participates in this tendency to elision, indirection, and even
outright resistance when it comes to establishing exactly what constitutes the
feminist novel.5 But perhaps these gymnastics are unsurprising: boundaries and
distinctions seem in tension with many of these scholars’ thesis that feminism is an
inclusive, additive, evolving project that “creates endless eddies and currents that
flow in often surprising and unexpected directions” in fiction.6 We extend this line
of argument by surfacing contemporary readers’ varied understandings of feminist
novels—understandings that, as we detail below, ultimately circle around feminist
32

novels as works of fiction that somehow engage with a sociopolitical project of
equity for all people, regardless of sex, gender, sexuality, and other categories of
identity.
Our project furthers this ongoing work on the merits of the feminist novel’s intrinsic
variability by probing its dynamics in four publishing contexts: contemporary
anglophone literary criticism, prestigious review publications, marketing materials,
and online book reviews by social readers. We explore how these interpretive
communities converge and diverge in their assessments of feminist fiction over the
past twenty-five years by evaluating articles from the MLA International
Bibliography, book reviews in The New York Times, The New Yorker, Times Literary
Supplement, and other prominent periodicals, blurbs from Amazon, and Goodreads
reviews. We trace the feminist novel’s ambivalent fates—or rather, feminist novels’
ambivalent fates—in and across these four domains. To do so, we build a corpus
comprised of 335 documents and nearly 5 million words drawn from their digital
platforms, in which the authors identify the text at hand as a feminist novel. We
analyze this corpus using a series of computational methods—topic modeling, most
distinctive word analysis, and named entity recognition—to illuminate the rhetorical
patterns of our subcorpora and then close read our findings to explore their
implications for the feminist novel. Specifically, we focus on which novels different
interpretive communities choose to discuss and how they discuss them. In so doing,
we consider how literary scholars can develop more robust understandings of what
feminism and feminist fiction mean to contemporary readers and what we stand to
gain by bringing this diverse interpretive labor into our scholarly conversations.
This approach extends ongoing work in reception studies by combining computational and close reading methods to evaluate prose content produced by literary
critics, book reviewers for high-profile periodicals, Amazon’s marketing team, and
social readers. As Melanie Walsh and Maria Antoniak have recently proposed,
“computational methods and internet data [from platforms like Goodreads and
Amazon], when combined, can help literary critics capture the creative explosion of
reader responses” and account for “readers’ own critical voices”—particularly when
the resulting findings are qualitatively analyzed as well.7 Indebted to Janice
Radway’s sociological work on gendered reading communities and genre fiction,
our synthetic attention to the readerly discourse of “actual subjects in history” across
33

A C O M P U T A T I O N A L A N A L Y S I S O F I N T E R P R E T I V E C O MM U N I T I E S

multiple interpretive communities allows us to examine the roles that sex and gender
play in contemporary reading cultures and helps us to consider feminism’s diverse
social purchase in the twenty-first-century English-speaking world.8
Our corpus and our methodology iterate our argument that the feminist novel is
multiple, collectively arbitrated, and open-ended—by definition and like feminism
itself. Our corpus comprises contemporary readers’ writing about novels rather than
the text of these novels themselves, as noted above. As we explain in detail below,
we recruit these platforms’ internal algorithms to produce this corpus, first
generating their respective lists of feminist novels and then populating the text
associated with these lists on each of the platforms (journal article content, book
reviews, marketing materials). This methodology allows us to examine how different
interpretive communities themselves classify and discuss novels vis-à-vis feminism,
rather than requires us to posit our own categorical assessments of what constitutes
feminist fiction. We refer to these subcorpora as interpretive communities because
they are comprised of published prose that addresses a network of other readers. As
Stanley Fish defines this foundational concept of reader response theory:
“interpretive communities are made up of those who share interpretive strategies not
for reading but for writing texts, for constituting their properties.”9 We are especially
interested in how the binding “interests, … purposes and goals” that drive this
collaborative meaning-making can be multiple, contentious, and unsettled—and
productively so.10
In the first two sections of this article, we contextualize our inclusive method of
corpus construction and its resulting hybrid dataset in terms of recent feminist work
in the digital humanities (DH) and in literary criticism centered on gender and
reception. In the third section, we gloss the metadata that situates our four
interpretive communities as intersecting but importantly distinct. The subsequent
four sections elucidate this generative dissensus by first employing a given
computational tool and then qualitatively evaluating our findings, both as a whole
and in terms of specific provocative examples. Our synthetic interpretive
approach—which we detail at length in our methods section—reveals these
communities’ shared topical investments in feminist fiction, though we will also
demonstrate that the communities talk about these topics in importantly different
ways. Together, their discourse converges on two organizing concerns: embodied
34

J OURNAL OF CU LTURAL A NALYTICS

subjectivity and temporality. These concerns align with Andrew Piper’s finding that
novelistic discourse emphasizes “phenomenological encounter,” with a “linguistic
investment [that …] falls overwhelmingly on sense perception and a sense of human
embodiment.”11 Piper argues that novelistic discourse focuses on “[n]ot the world
itself, but a person’s encounter with and reflection upon that world—the world’s
feltness.”12 A key finding of our work is that discourse about the novel shares this
focus. Moreover, we find that this nonfictional discourse takes up questions of
embodied subjectivity in terms of the temporally-marked “social horizon”—“things
‘out there’”—that Piper identifies with nonfiction.13 Readers from the four
interpretive communities that we analyze consistently bring this “combination of
sense perception plus cognitive skepticism” to bear in discussions of feminist
considerations and then extend this phenomenological orientation outward—linking
the personal to the political, to invoke a clichéd feminist truism.14
More specifically, readers assess novels’ feminist qualities in terms of three aspects
of temporally-oriented embodied subjectivity: 1) as the experience of living in our
minded bodies, particularly in terms of thinking and feeling; 2) as socially
constructed, especially in terms of intersectional categories of identity (e.g., by race,
class, and ability as well as by sex and gender); and 3) as relays between individual,
idiosyncratic being and collective life and community belonging. As we discuss in
sequence below, the configurations of these aspects of personhood in time inform
the communities’ vocabularies (“What We Talk About When We Talk About
Feminist Novels”), their modes of self-address (“How We Talk Distinctively When
We Talk About Feminist Novels”), the rationales they offer for reading feminist
novels (“Why Read Feminist Novels?”), and the forms of feminist subjectivity they
promote (“Who We Talk About When We Talk About Feminist Novels”). Our
analysis thus suggests how novel reading can function as a mode of forging feminist
knowledge and constructing feminist value systems: through imagined
conversations with other readers, individuals and the interpretive communities in
which they participate undertake this additive, pluralistic revisionary process with a
connection to the past, a grounding in the present, and a commitment to ever-better
futures. In so doing, contemporary readers reflexively redefine understandings of the
feminist novel. Put differently: if these interpretive communities posit that there is
no such thing as the feminist novel, we observe in turn that feminist novels are
always in the making by their readership.

Feminist Scholarship in Digital Humanities and Literary
Criticism
Our project takes its archival, methodological, and other theoretical and practical
cues from ongoing work in feminist DH that foregrounds synthesis, inclusivity, and
embodiment as crucial modes of knowledge production. In Data Feminism (2020)
Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein ask, “What makes a project feminist? …
[A] project may be feminist in content, in that it challenges power by choice of
subject matter; in form, in that it challenges power by shifting the aesthetic and/or
sensory registers of data communication; and/or in process, in that it challenges
power by building participatory, inclusive processes of knowledge production.”15
Similarly, Elizabeth Losh and Jacqueline Wernimont’s edited collection Bodies of
Information: Intersectional Feminism and Digital Humanities (2018) pushes beyond
“the representational politics of feminisms” to “assert that these feminisms function
as sophisticated forms of critical theory.”16 In particular, Losh and Wernimont
highlight “the material, situated, contingent, tacit, embodied, affective, laborintensive and political characteristics of digital archives and their supporting
infrastructures and practices” that feminist DH practitioners utilize to “express[]
their concerns about present-day power relations and signify[] interest in collective
and communal consciousness-raising efforts.”17 Our corpus gives equal attention to,
and derives a majority of content from, non-scholarly critics, and, as we detail below,
our computational and qualitative methods seek to gain purchase on readers’
reflections on their “material, situated, contingent” experiences of being in the
world.
Our work also dialogues with recent scholarship that looks beyond literary content
to consider how sex and gender shape the broader field of anglophone cultural
production. This work participates in a tradition of sociological criticism focused on
gender and reception, such as Janice Radway’s ethnographic studies of the
readership of romance novels and Joan Shelley Rubin’s recovery of the tastemaking
institutions and individuals engaged with so-called middlebrow culture.18 Recent
efforts to rethink literary history by centering marginalized interpretive communities
analyze “mass-produced literary texts … [as] used by real people” in conversation
with more traditionally authoritative cultural sources as well as with one another and

36

J OURNAL OF CU LTURAL A NALYTICS

engage in a multi-modal practice to do so.19 For instance, Rita Felski’s Hooked: Art
and Attachment (2020) “looks closely at how people connect to novels” and other
media by combining ethnography, biography, and book history, among other modes
of inquiry, and does so in order to draw out “similarities that are often overlooked”
between “ordinary and academic interpretation.”20 Timothy Aubry differently
elucidates how “readers creatively appropriate and reimagine” contemporary
American novels “in order to make them serve a variety of personal and practical
functions” by merging literary critical readings of these texts with analyses of The
Oprah Winfrey Show’s Book Club discussions, Amazon Customer Reviews, and
more.21 In a third example of work along these lines, Elizabeth Long harnesses
longitudinal ethnographic interviews with participants in women’s book clubs along
with cultural history and close reading to probe the intellectual and interpersonal
import of discussing private reading in social collectives.22 Long and Aubry situate
themselves in Radway’s lineage in a manner akin to Felski’s opening gambit: “How,
asks Janice Radway, can we more fully engage the vitality and ongoingness, the
forward trajectory and the unsecured nature, of social processes” and do so “without
pitching aesthetic experience outside the social world”?23 Our project likewise draws
its critical and creative energy from this provocation.
DH scholars participate in this ongoing line of critical inquiry by combining
computational and traditional approaches to explore textual objects beyond
canonical literature and readers beyond the academy. Matthew J. Lavin examines
how the “crucial categorical norm” of gender influences critical reception and
cultural capital by using machine learning and traditional book historical approaches
to evaluate early twentieth-century New York Times book reviews.24 Finding
“gendered patterns in both subject matter and structural vocabularies of [these] book
reviews,” Lavin identifies a “division between ‘what men write about’ and ‘what
women write about’ that has not been observed when primary texts such as novels
were analyzed using large scale, computational methods.”25 Karen Bourrier and
Mike Thelwall differently explore how gendered cultural expectations drive “the
social lives of books” by comparing the incidence of women authors and female
characters in Victorian literature on Goodreads, in the MLA International
Bibliography, and on syllabi from the Open Syllabus Project.26 Bourrier and
Thelwall find “a strong correlation between” academic and popular selections of
Victorian literature but observe importantly distinct modes of discussing these
37

A C O M P U T A T I O N A L A N A L Y S I S O F I N T E R P R E T I V E C O MM U N I T I E S

works: Goodreads reviews manifest supposedly “unacademic forms of reading”
such as “readerly identification, reading for character, and reading for plot” that are
no less sophisticated and politically engaged in their commitments to strong female
protagonists.27 Melanie Walsh and Maria Antoniak similarly seek “to hear
nonacademic readers’ voices” at a scale “difficult if not impossible before the
internet” by analyzing 120,000 reviews of 144 “classics” as most shelved and read
by Goodreads users.28 While demonstrating that Goodreads reviewers participate in
a robust, cross-media “classics industry,” Walsh and Antoniak emphasize that the
platform nonetheless compensates these users by offering them “a chance to reflect
on their lives and relationships to power, a conduit for connecting to others, and an
opportunity to enter a critical conversation that has long excluded them.”29 Thus, in
addition to these projects’ topical interests in sex and gender, their praxis also aligns
with feminist investments as they seek to leverage DH methods to interpellate
additional interpretive communities into academic discourse and, in so doing, to
democratize the intellectual labor of literary criticism.
Our project also participates in ongoing work in feminist literary criticism by
scholars focused on anglophone prose production. Recent work in this field tends to
employ a both/and strategy in response to a lineage of frequently polarized
approaches to literature by and about woman-identified individuals. Monographs by
Suzanne Bost, Shelley Fisher Fishkin, Sharon Patricia Holland, Tanya Ann
Kennedy, and Emily Westkaemper and anthologies such as Anthropocene Feminism
(2017) and The Bloomsbury Handbook of 21st-Century Feminist Theory (2019)
discuss literary objects in terms of their aesthetic qualities and their cultural work,

and

works
together
with
massmarket/popular/middlebrow/“genre” fiction, consider the overlapping audiences and
plural reception histories of this media, and foreground the intersectional
identities—and especially the formative work of race, ethnicity, sexuality, class,
ability, and nationality—that shape individuals’ actually lived lives as well as textual
representations of embodied experience.30 Like Bourrier and Thelwall’s project,
much of this work seeks to revalue supposedly naïve reading practices including a
focus on plot and narrative realism and an interest in character and the workings of
attachment and identification.31
This work variously responds to the questions Felski poses at the outset of Literature
38

J OURNAL OF CU LTURAL A NALYTICS

After Feminism (2003): “How … does feminist criticism change the way we think
about readers? Does plot have a gender? How have feminists talked about female
authors? What is the role of value in feminist scholarship?”32 We, too, take up these
questions in exploring how different readers answer her second, third, and fourth
questions. As we detail following the discussion of our methodology below, our
analysis indicates that individuals identify and imagine different plot structures as
feminist. For example, a three-star Goodreads review of Zora Neale Hurston’s Their
Eyes Were Watching God (1937) asserts, “Janie was badass up until she met Tea
Cake. Then it was ‘Feminism? What feminism?’” Yet another Goodreads reviewer
locates Hurston’s feminism in this romantic plot, claiming that “many of us … don’t
recognize the power within ourselves to be strong and capable until we’ve been
screwed over by a man.” Within and across interpretive communities, readers
differently evaluate the same narrative in terms of progressive values and
commitments to equity and prosocial change. Our answer to Felski’s first question,
then, includes a pluralization of reading practices and communities, with a particular
interest in the experiential as well as ideological values these practices prioritize and
these communities assert.

Methods & Corpus
Our corpus consists of a total of 4,945,592 words comprised of literary criticism
(LC), prestige review publications (PR), Amazon marketing materials (AM), and
Goodreads reviews (GR), all published over the past quarter century. We built this
corpus as follows (see Figure 1 for a tabular overview):
1. We began with LC. We searched in the full text of articles indexed by the
MLA International Bibliography for “feminist novel” and “feminist fiction,”
filtering for peer reviewed journal articles published on or after January 1,
1995 written in English about anglophone novels or novels translated to
English of all periods. We seek to surface readers’ understandings of the
feminist novel, but we needed to define some search terms to identify these
objects. We therefore determined to use the most explicit identification
available: “feminist novel.” This initial search term yielded 34 results. We
wanted a larger corpus and more novels identified as feminist, so we expanded
to “feminist fiction,” which yielded 21 results. When we excluded articles that
39

A C O M P U T A T I O N A L A N A L Y S I S O F I N T E R P R E T I V E C O MM U N I T I E S

did not identify specific novels as feminist (e.g. short book reviews of
monographs) or that were about non-anglophone novels, the results yielded a
total corpus of 40 literary critical articles that identified 58 discrete novels as
feminist. We downloaded these articles using our institutional permissions
and created plain text files of the full text, including titles, abstracts (if
published in the downloaded article), and footnotes, producing a total
subcorpus of 314,975 words.33
2. For PR, we searched for “feminist novel” in The New York Times Book
Review, The New Yorker, The Los Angeles Review of Books, TIME, Times
Literary Supplement, The Washington Post, Slate, Jezebel, and London
Review of Books’ respective search functions, filtering for articles published
on or after January 1, 1995 about anglophone novels or novels translated to
English in all periods.34 This search returned 97 prestige review articles that
identified 87 discrete novels as feminist. We downloaded these articles using
our institutional permissions and created plain text files of the full text,
including titles, producing a total subcorpus of 144,131 words.
3. For AM, we searched Amazon Books for “feminist novel.” Amazon’s search
function does not include a filter for the date of materials release or web
posting, but as the site did not begin selling media until 1998, all materials
were produced after January 1, 1995. This search returned 240 results. In order
to build a subcorpus with a word count in the same order of magnitude as our
other subcorpora, we determined to use the top 128 novels written in or
translated to English across all time periods. For these 128 novels, we created
plain text files of blurbs, editorial reviews, and first chapter “preview”
excerpts (if published on Amazon’s site), producing a subcorpus totaling
152,587 words.35
4. For GR, we identified the top 70 novels written in or translated to English
shelved—meaning identified by readers—as “feminist,” as of May 2020.
Goodreads’ search function does not include a filter for the date of materials
release or web posting, but as the site did not launch until January 2007, all
materials were produced after January 1, 1995. We included novels from all
time periods. The “feminist” shelf contains many texts that are not novels,
such as memoirs and cultural histories, which we excluded. We also excluded
any reviews not written in English. We created plain text files of the reviews
of each novel, including roughly equivalent word counts for each of the five
40

J OURNAL OF CU LTURAL A NALYTICS

star categories (1 to 5 stars), producing a subcorpus totaling 4,333,899 words
across 350 documents (5 documents per each of the 70 novels). As we explain
in relevant sections below, for certain methods we downsampled this data by
including reviews from across all star categories in one plain text file for each
novel to produce a representative sample of 358,551 words across 70
documents, yielding a more comparable number of words across subcorpora.
For each of these novels, we populated metadata including publication year and
author gender.

Figure 1. Summary at a glance of the contents and size of each subcorpus; we detail the overlaps in titles (column
three here) in the following section.

These communities overlap in their content ownership and production as well as
their interpretive interests. Most notably, Amazon owns at least half of our
subcorpora, as the company acquired Goodreads in 2013 for $150 million.36 Many
readers also participate in multiple interpretive communities. For instance, young
adult (YA) novelist Jennifer Mathieu, author of the 2017 YA novel Moxie (identified
as feminist by GR), recently reviewed a children’s book about middle school dress
codes in The New York Times.37 Similarly, Washington Post book critic Ron Charles
often self-markets by posting snippets from his reviews on Goodreads, just as many
41

A C O M P U T A T I O N A L A N A L Y S I S O F I N T E R P R E T I V E C O MM U N I T I E S

social readers direct readers to their personal book review blogs hosted off
Goodreads. We attend to these exchanges by comparing computational models of
individual interpretive communities to those of our corpus as a whole and
elaborating these models through close reading of each community’s published
prose.
Our methodology recruits the communities’ internal logics to generate their
respective lists of novels, via their proprietary platforms, search algorithms, and
organizing functions (see Appendix for complete lists). This approach bears out
Katherine Bode’s call for centering the “real epistemic, ethical, and political
challenges” of constructing DH data sets and, more broadly, of “building a field in
which humanities and statistical ways of knowing coexist and enhance each other.”38
It also iterates D’Ignazio and Klein’s argument for “participatory, inclusive
processes of knowledge production” in DH work.39 This approach further performs
intersectional feminist commitments to theorizing individual experience in dialogue
with collective understanding, as it allows us to observe textual patterns across many
readers’ prose artifacts and then synthesize this larger-scale cultural analysis with
attention to individual readers’ responses.
We describe these methods in greater detail at the beginning of each section that
follows. We start with a discussion of our metadata about the novels in our corpus,
which we uploaded into and analyzed using Tableau. We then turn to the
computational methods we pursued in sequence.

Community Consensus
As Figure 2 demonstrates, only one author appears in all four subcorpora, Marilyn
French. Nine authors appear in three of the four subcorpora: Naomi Alderman,
Margaret Atwood, Kate Chopin, Erica Jong, Chris Kraus, Doris Lessing, Toni
Morrison, Alice Walker, and Virginia Woolf.

colored by subcorpus. For complete lists of each author appearing in each subcorpus, please see Appendix.

Figure 3 shows that there is no single novel that appears in all four subcorpora, but
four novels appear in three of four subcorpora: Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale
(1985), Chopin’s The Awakening (1899), Kraus’s I Love Dick (1997), and
Alderman’s The Power (2016). There are no novels in common between AM and
LC, suggesting the divergence of literary critics and consumer-driven marketers as
well as reflecting the feminist novel’s multiplicity and collective arbitration in the
contemporary literary field.

Individual interpretive communities also express more internal consensus about
authors than novels. The following authors and texts appear more than twice in the
same domain: Erica Jong’s Fear of Flying (1973) appears in five literary critical
articles, while Alix Kates Shulman’s Memoirs of an Ex-Prom Queen (1972) appears
in three articles. Meg Wolitzer’s The Female Persuasion (2018) appears in six
prestige review articles. Atwood has eight different texts shelved “feminist” in
Goodreads, spanning five decades of literary production: The Edible Woman (1969),
The Handmaid’s Tale (1985), Cat’s Eye (1988), The Robber Bride (1993), Alias
Grace (1996), The Blind Assassin (2000), The Penelopiad (2005), and The
Testaments (2019). Suzanne Collins and Virginia Woolf each have three texts
shelved in Goodreads (Collins: The Hunger Games (2008), Catching Fire (2009),
Mockingjay (2010); Woolf: Mrs. Dalloway (1925), To The Lighthouse (1927),
Orlando (1928)). As these findings suggest, these communities identify feminist
novels as largely written by women: the entire corpus only includes thirty discrete
novels by male-identified authors out of 313 unique novels overall. However, there
are novels written by male-identified authors in all four subcorpora, with AM

44

J OURNAL OF CU LTURAL A NALYTICS

featuring the most male-identified (thirteen).40 These findings suggest that, in the
cross-section of our corpus, marketers have been more invested than other
interpretive communities in the idea that non-female-identifying authors could
contribute to the body of feminist novels.
These findings also indicate that feminist fiction has a long, unevenly distributed
history that tends to serve the present. Figure 4 shows subcorpora by novel
publication year. We see a density of novels post-1920s and particularly post-1960s.
These temporal dynamics align with the overall increase and specific documented
trends in novel publishing over the course of the twentieth and early twenty-first
centuries.41 However, the timeline also rehearses familiar date markers in the
traditional wave model of historical feminisms. Figure 5 focuses in on this
contemporary density. These temporal maps may suggest that current readers recruit
feminist fiction that serves their immediate needs and thus look to pasts that serve
these transformative future-minded aims. We imagine, for example, that searching
LC and PR outlets with a time range of 1970 to 1995 would have resulted in novels
with more temporal diversity, as professional critics sought to recuperate a
genealogy of female authors and craft a feminist canon (perhaps obviously, however,
and as mentioned in the corpus construction section above, this earlier timeframe
would have been impossible for GR and AM). The contemporary interpretive
communities’ diverse timeframes suggest that each cohort seeks different resources
to sustain its present-day work. In particular, the findings suggest that LC invests
more heavily in the past, while AM invests more heavily in the present.

Figure 5. Subcorpora by novel publication year, 1980-present. Atwood appears multiple times, but we also see a more
generically diverse landscape, with Suzanne Collins’s bestselling Hunger Games trilogy appearing alongside other
YA fiction, including Libba Bray’s Beauty Queens. Similarly, Tracy Summer’s Amazon.com Services LLC-published
Steamy Historical Romance Boxset is identified alongside Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s National Book Critics Circle

Our metadata thus reveals a productive discord across interpretive communities
about 1) who writes feminist novels, 2) what these novels are, and 3) the timeframes
in which these novels appear. The metadata indicates more consensus about
identifying authors as feminists, rather than novels as such, both across interpretive
communities and within them. The metadata also demonstrates the ways in which a
sense of when feminist literature proliferates changes to serve different readers.
These findings suggest a potential distancing from the seeming essentialism, or at
least cohesion, of “feminist” as an adjectival descriptor, as opposed to the openended nature of feminism as an encompassing concept. For example, Goodreads’
“feminism” shelf is much more robust than its “feminist” shelf, both in the total
number of texts shelved and the number of times readers have shelved its top seventy
novels as “feminism.” This disparity perhaps reflects feminism’s definitional
instability, as individuals appear to be more comfortable identifying people with the
noun (a feminist as a type of person who is committed to women’s rights and gender
equity), rather than applying the overdetermined adjective to a given novel that is
then imagined to comprehensively promote a specific, coherently articulated
political project.

What We Talk About When We Talk About Feminist Novels
Topic models can help us probe these interpretive communities’ shared interests in
feminist fiction. We produced our models using Mallet with default settings (20 top
terms for each topic) and removing stopwords.42 We then looked at the posterior
probabilities of the words in each topic and the topics in each document. We were
interested in the relationships between the topical investments of corpus documents,
both within each subcorpus and across subcorpora, so we endeavored to see what
could be surfaced by “reading” the models themselves (rather than, for instance,
analyzing individual corpus documents for their proportion of topics). We then
produced a principal component analysis (PCA), transforming the topics’ highdimensional data into principal components that we could visualize in two
dimensions on a PCA biplot.
We are sensitive to the concerns of interpreting topic models that Benjamin M.
Schmidt has highlighted and Mark Algee-Hewitt has recently elaborated.43 As
Schmidt has demonstrated, topics are not as “coherent” and “stable” as one might
assume; we therefore adopt his recommendation of “ground[ing] the analysis of
topic models in the words they are built from” by analyzing the terms of each topic
in the context in which they appear across the documents.44 Algee-Hewitt
emphasizes that “lists of top terms may overrepresent extremely high or low
frequency terms at the expense of more meaningful words; labeling topics often
overgeneralizes their specificity; and networks of topics are still based on a limited
list of top terms.”45 We assess topical coherence and seek out patterns across a given
topic’s top terms, thereby attempting to avoid a facile reading of lists of top terms
and to refrain from overly reading into individual words. Finally, we employ PCA
to understand the topical distribution in the larger picture of our heterogenous
corpus. We remain cautious about the pitfalls of topic modeling as an explanatory
method and therefore employ topic modeling as an exploratory metric and engage
other computational methods in tandem.46
Table 6 presents a 10-topic model of the full corpus. Overall, the contents of our
model suggest how discussions of the feminist novel center on questions of
personhood and temporality, with topics often drawing more heavily on one or the
other concern but consistently addressing them both.47 Questions of personhood

drive topics 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7; questions of time drive topics 2, 8, and 9. Topic 0,
for example, addresses maternal corporeality (“mother,” “desire,” “body”); topic 3
addresses anglophone nationality (“social,” “political,” “english,” “british”); topic 5
addresses gender and race (“unnatural,” “gender,” “black”); and topic 6 addresses
biopolitics (“gender,” “war,” “oil,” “body”). Meanwhile, topic 2 addresses domestic
temporality (“years,” “day,” “time,” “home”); topic 8 addresses an extended
historical arc of feminist sexuality (“sex,” “radical,” “movement,” “liberation”); and
topic 9 addresses the building of social worlds in time (“lives,” “society,” “change,”
“past”).

Figure 6: A 10-topic model of the full corpus.

At the same time, using a PCA biplot we can see how different communities engage
these topics differently. Figure 7 shows a PCA biplot for this model, with the
principal components (PCs) accounting for 54.96 percent of the cumulative
proportion of variance. The red arrows represent the topic loadings for PC1 and PC2
and function to spatially distribute all corpus documents according to their topical
investments. Thus, this biplot indicates a strong differentiation between the four
interpretive communities, with the most topical overlap between the LC and PR
communities. The biplot also indicates that AM and GR are largely separated by two
individual topics: topic 1 works along the PC1 axis, particularly determining the
clustering of AM documents (in coral) at the top left; topic 4 particularly determines
the clustering of GR documents (in green) at the top right. Meanwhile, PR
documents (in purple) operate in a space between AM and GR.
This distribution suggests LC’s tendency to discuss personhood in more abstract,
historically extended terms (topic 5), whereas AM tends to discuss people in terms
of contemporary critical regard (topic 1) and GR tends to discuss personal
preferences in an immediate context (topic 4). In topic 1, for example, “author” and
“woman” appear alongside rhetoric suggestive of The New York Times and other
book reviews and literary prizes. In topic 4, the first-person pronoun “I” appears
alongside the discourse of affective assessment (“good,” “don’t,” “feel,” “felt”).
These discursive distinctions also appear in the time-oriented topics, with topic 2’s
discourse of domestic temporality particularly determining the distribution of AM
and PR documents, topic 8’s extended historical arc particularly determining that of
LC documents, and topic 9’s attention to social worldbuilding particularly
determining that of GR documents.

Figure 7: A PCA biplot of the 10-topic model of the full corpus.

More specifically, topics tend to coalesce around corporeal experience; social
structures of gender, race, class, sexuality, and nationality; and concerns of past,
present, and future. However, different interpretive communities use different
language to indicate these same topical fields. Figures 8 and 9 suggest that social
readers privilege immediate individual experience in their assessments of feminist
fiction, while literary critics emphasize more abstracted social collectives over
longer stretches of time. Figure 8 juxtaposes two 5-topic topic models: one of the 1star and another of the 5-star reviews of the GR subcorpus.48 The figure features
directive negative (1-star) and laudatory positive (5-star) rhetoric alongside attention
to plot and character—combinations that suggest readers recommend novels based
on their embodied literary encounters. In the 1-star model, topic 1 warns others
against reading a novel with words like “don’t” and “bad” alongside “character” and
“plot” as key determinants in these assessments. Topic 3 highlights that issues of
racial representation (“white,” “black”) often undergird readers’ negative reviews—
an observation borne out by our close reading of these reviews. Topic 4 addresses
high or “classic” “literature,” with “boring” and “didn’t” constellating responses to
novels frequently assigned in school. By contrast, the 5-star review topic model
50

J OURNAL OF CU LTURAL A NALYTICS

manifests affective and emotional positivity (in topic 0: “yeah,” “girls,” “women,”
“amazing,” “important,” “love,” “loved”) and captures the value of personal
identification (in topic 1, the pronoun “I” and gerund “reading” are tightly knit with
“real” “character” and “characters”).

The 10-topic model of the LC subcorpus in Figure 9 suggests that literary critics
discuss historically contextualized collectives in their analyses of feminist
embodiment.49 For example, topic 7 addresses issues of racial representation by
highlighting the histories of slavery and its ethics (“slavery,” “white,” “black,”
“slave,” “enslaved”). Topic 1 registers a range of minority experiences, particularly
within geopolitical conflicts (the “south,” “africa,” “black”), while topic 2 discusses
sex and sexuality in terms of liberal politics. Topics 5, 8, and 9 highlight the temporal
dimensions of collective human experience. Topic 5 highlights the domestic novel’s
class contours as well as one of its key historical periods, the Victorian era. Topic 8
addresses broad questions of feminist history, while topic 9 raises questions of
utopian futurity. Suggesting LC’s tendencies to abstraction, topics 0, 4, and 9 treat
concerns of literary personhood more theoretically (“narrative” and “discourse”) and
make them more social than individual (“patriarchal,” “world,” “bodies”).50 The GR
and LC topic models thus suggest the feminist priorities of each interpretive
community: LC emphasizes broad historical phenomena and validates embodied
experience by rendering it an intellectual concern; GR highlights the visceral
impacts of these phenomena on individuals and renders feminism a project of urgent
feeling.

How We Talk Distinctively When We Talk About Feminist
Novels
Most distinctive word (MDW) analysis allows us to further investigate the
interpretive communities’ interests. As Sarah Allison et al. describe, MDW analysis
calculates the “average, or ‘expected,’ frequency” of all the words of a large corpus,
then calculates “the actual—or ‘observed’—occurrence” of each word in different
component parts of the corpus, in order to highlight “those instances that reveal[] a
significant observed-over-expected ratio.”51 MDW tests are independent tests of
each word versus the rest of the vocabulary. We tested the significance of each oddsratio with a Fisher’s exact test, producing a P-value; we only returned results with
P-values under 0.05. This method indicates which words appear more often than
statistically expected in one subcorpus versus another and so, in the terms of our
project, captures which words are most distinctive of a given interpretive
community. We filtered our MDW results by subcorpus and in order of statistical
significance. We then looked for patterns in the resulting MDWs.
Figure 10 showcases the people who distinctively characterize each subcorpus,
including characters, novelists, political figures, and other critics. Our reading of
these patterns suggests that LC and PR distinctively highlight the historically living
53

A C O M P U T A T I O N A L A N A L Y S I S O F I N T E R P R E T I V E C O MM U N I T I E S

beings who produce and professionally discuss feminist literature, while GR and
AM lean into the fictive worlds these historical figures create. These distinctions
may well be consistent with the broader differences between these four interpretive
communities and their respective priorities, but our point is not about how the
communities uniquely discuss feminist fiction as compared to other genres of
literature. Rather, MDW analysis allows us further purchase on how these
communities highlight different kinds of persons, which in the case of our dataset
are people who variously interface with feminist concerns, past and present. LC
distinctively mentions political figures and other critics (e.g., “lukacs,” “irigaray,”
“millett,” “theorists,” “critics”), while PR references authors and then characters
(e.g., “heti,” “kraus,” “didion”; “zoe,” “prue,” “lena”). GR reverses PR’s priorities,
distinctively discussing characters more prevalently than authors—but with a
markedly different cast of individuals (e.g., “rochester,” “katniss”; “atwood,”
“austen”). AM, like GR, prioritizes characters and then authors, though again with a
different cast of people (e.g., “oliphant,” “beowulf”; “mackintosh,” “quinn”). These
differences between professional and social readers echo recent feminist literary
criticism that recenters character as a topic of scholarly discourse and does so in part
to counter narratives of social readers’ supposedly naïve tendencies to readercharacter identification.52

Figure 10. MDWs by subcorpus illustrating how these communities highlight different kinds of feminist persons. While
all MDWs can be examined in our results, MDWs are here organized by subcorpus according to our close reading of
trends. We list entries for each subcorpus—and within each subcorpus, each subjectively determined “interpretive
label”—in descending order by odds-ratio.

55

A C O M P U T A T I O N A L A N A L Y S I S O F I N T E R P R E T I V E C O MM U N I T I E S

The MDWs in Figure 11 indicate a second preoccupation of these interpretive
communities: the process of reading and review, or what one might call community
practice. Each subcorpus’s discussions of community practice prioritize the
intersubjective network within which these literary texts are evaluated, though their
modes of engaging with these collectives range from impersonal and self-distancing
to intimate and disclosing. LC and PR express the former. LC distinctively focuses
on literary critical assessment, including periodizations of “nineteenth-” and
“twentieth-century” along with other academic terminology that “argue[s]” about
“hegemonic” values, “performativity,” “narratology,” and “poetics.” PR
foregrounds authorial microhistory, discussing the “novelist” at hand and drawing
attention to the hallmarks of publishing success, such as the numbers of “copies”
sold, “publications” to date, and “television” appearances. These communities’
prose trends minimize individual reviewers’ selfhood by emphasizing external
contexts of literary history or authorial biography.
By contrast, GR and AM are more self-referential in their distinctive vocabularies.
GR emphasizes the personal experience of reading and review, including
abbreviations of popular terms such as “dnf” (did not finish) and “pov,” selfconscious references to “rating,” “stars,” and “hype,” and a distinctive mix of
negative and positive assessments, ranging from “annoying,” “depressing,”
“boring,” and “disappointed” to “enjoyed” and “appreciate.” AM emphasizes other,
largely digital external platforms of review (e.g., “buzzfeed,” “lithub,” “esquire,”
“booklist,” “bustle,” “tribune,” “bookpage,” “kirkus”). Interestingly, GR is the only
subcorpus with a MDW that comes from community practice—“pov” followed by
“dnf”—whereas the other three prioritize people.
All four interpretive communities thus prioritize selfhood in talking about feminist
fiction, but center different selves in these discussions. The professional
communities of LC and PR once again hang together in these discussions. These
subcorpora prioritize similar types of people—those who read and discuss
literature—even as their community practice largely obfuscates reviewers’
individual selves. By contrast, GR and AM focus on how the people inside the pages
speak to readers’ individual subjectivities—personally and retrospectively for GR
(“I felt X about the protagonist”) and generically and prospectively for AM (“buy
this book and you, too, will experience these feelings”).

Figure 11. MDWs by subcorpus suggesting each subcorpus’s discussions of community practice.

Why Read Feminist Novels?
MDW results also allow us to posit that the rationales different interpretive
communities offer for reading feminist novels are driven by the forms of subjectivity
they value. Our interpretation of the MDW results indicates that literary critics value
feminist subjectivity as a long-standing sociopolitical identity committed to equity,
inclusion, and diversity. LC’s MDW results indicate that both “feminist” and the
corollary “feminism” are observed in LC around 1.88 times more likely than
expected.53 Close reading of individual LC documents elaborates the critical values
that this keyword magnetizes. For example, Melanie Micir’s article “The Impossible
Miss Woolf: Kate Atkinson and the Feminist Modernist Historical Novel” (2017)
situates Atkinson’s Life After Life (2013) as “belonging to a genealogy of feminist
historiography,” arguing “that Atkinson’s methodology descends from both
modernist and feminist arguments about how to write the history of marginalized
subjects.”54 Micir’s “feminist” thus links Atkinson’s novel to a lineage of text-based
recovery projects that are understood to enrich models of historical experience as
well as enhance the accuracy of claims about cultural production. Micir’s use of the
term further associates her own scholarship with this esteemed ongoing project.
MDW analysis combined with such close reading also indicates that LC and GR
tend to evaluate exclusionary models of feminist sensibility, though they employ
different language to do so. “Nonfeminist” only appears fourteen times in the entire
corpus and primarily (12 times) in LC.55 Close reading of LC documents suggests
that literary critics employ this language to compare narratological strategies and
reader responses according to a feminist/nonfeminist binary, with both narratives

60

J OURNAL OF CU LTURAL A NALYTICS

and readers identified according to this logic. One such example, Ellen Peel’s
“Unnatural Feminist Narratology” (2016), differentiates “feminist and nonfeminist
readers” of Joanna Russ’s science fiction novel The Female Man (1975), only to
assert that the novel itself challenges a monolithic heteronormative model of
feminism: “the text’s values are clear: it sympathizes with feminisms.”56 GR
registers a similar pluralizing logic with more popular politicized language. For
example, a 2-star review of Moxie asserts, “Seek out other feminist voices after you
read this: queer feminists, POC feminists, trans feminists, disabled feminists.
Feminism is intersectional and includes all these (and other) marginalized people, or
it’s bullshit.”57 As these distinct ways of talking about feminism’s collective project
suggest, social readers mobilize the concrete, individual-embodied and temporally
specific language of race and skin color to advocate for intersectionality, while
literary critics employ more abstract lexicons to address the histories and ongoing
presence of oppression—even as their own rhetoric is at times less inclusive than the
vision they elsewhere propound.
While LC and GR assume their own evaluative capacities in assessing and
promoting a novel for its feminism, AM contends one should read feminist novels
because other trusted persons say so. AM’s MDW results invoke prize-awarders,
consumers, and literary critics, suggesting one should read these novels because they
are “award-winning” and “bestselling.” These superlatives presumably reflect AM’s
broader marketing aims and are not necessarily specifically distinctive of feminist
novels on the platform. However, the language importantly distinguishes AM’s
discourse about feminist fiction from that of the other three subcorpora. Leigh
Stein’s runaway hit Self Care (2020) is a case in point. The featured blurbs include
Elle’s description as “a novel of manners for our 280-character era,” at once evoking
historical precedent (classic and timeless) and pitch-perfect contemporaneity
(mordant and timely).58 Figure 12 lists other AM MDW results, all of which
apparently seek to convince potential customers to purchase novels because they
provoke positive affective and intellectual responses to which other people,
including Oprah Winfrey, can attest, having already bought and read them.59 Oprah’s
distinctiveness here merges the discursive practices of LC and AM: as both a
representative of nonwhite feminism and the consummate embodiment of corporate
feminism, Oprah embodies a superior evaluative subjectivity and a subjectivity
whose evaluation makes or breaks a book.

Figure 12: MDW results for AM subcorpus, again listed in descending order by odds-ratio.

In sum, LC is more likely to label novels or people “feminist” in order to value them
as part of an historically informed sociopolitical cultural project, while GR discusses
these commitments using more recently emergent politicized rhetoric. By contrast,
AM relies on vaunted collectives’ preferences as it promotes novels based on their
prizewinning or bestselling success.
In contrast to AM’s assertive extremes, LC and GR register emotional and
intellectual uncertainty and complexity as valued modes of feminist subjectivity—
or at least as thoughts and feelings that come along with valuing feminist subjectivity
(Figure 13). The words “subjectivities” and “subjectivity” are distinctive of LC. A
close reading of LC’s MDW results suggest the ambivalence of this psychic

formation, as the list is rife with terms that connote conflict, multiplicity, and
indecision (e.g., “alternatives,” “alienation,” “anxieties,” “limitations,”
“boundaries,” “failure,” “crisis,” “both,” “between,” “impossible”). These MDW
results add nuance to the positive attributions of feminist across the subcorpus. Even
as LC engages feminist as an affirmative descriptor, the term describes conflicted,
often highly contested, contexts and registers novels’, authors’, and characters’
contradictory responses to these challenging circumstances. These LC MDW results
also remain associated with a valued white masculine subjectivity that dates back to
the rise of New Criticism.60 This language can therefore be seen to confer intellectual
prestige, though the vexed embodied experiences the rhetoric seeks to describe are
hardly to be envied.61 For its part, GR registers such conflicts in terms of readers’
mixed feelings, featuring borderline subjective responses like “guess,” “confusing,”
and “seem” alongside more definitive evaluative terms like “totally” and
“absolutely.” As noted above and detailed below, social readers also express anxiety
about using the adjective “feminist” to describe a novel, in part because they imagine
the genre to operate in complex, less straightforward relations to such political
investments. Across these subcorpora, ambivalence emerges as a persistent
experience of feminism, alternately vaunted, valued, rued, and regretted.62

Who We Talk About When We Talk About Feminist Novels
NER yields a more granular view of the selves who are mentioned in each
interpretive community’s discussions of the feminist novel. To generate this data,
we used David Bamman’s BookNLP tool for NER, producing semantically parsed
spreadsheets for each document that we then filtered for “person” to analyze the
named entities who appear therein.63 This gave us a measure of the number and
identities of people mentioned within each document of each subcorpus. We then
calculated the frequency of named entities in each subcorpus relative to its total word
count. Finally, we were especially curious about the nature of the people each
interpretive community mentioned, especially in discussions of the same novel, so
we selected several texts that appeared across multiple interpretive communities,
reviewed their NER results, and analyzed them qualitatively via close reading. Our
results thus extend the anthropocentric findings of our MDW analysis by capturing
the individuals associated with feminist novels as they appear within each subcorpus.
LC had the highest proportion of named entities at 3.92%, closely followed by PR
at 3.89% and AM at 3.48%. These numbers are roughly double that of GR, where
named entities constitute only 1.78% of total word count. The relatively high
proportion of references to people in LC, PR, and AM suggests that in these three
64

J OURNAL OF CU LTURAL A NALYTICS

interpretive communities, novels accrue cultural value by connecting subjectivities
within a densely populated intergenerational critical and creative network. By
contrast, as we have seen, Goodreads readers tend to emphasize first-person
experience and therefore, we hypothesize, place less value on critical and creative
forebears in favor of engaging other social readers as interlocutors. A close reading
of GR’s NER results, however, indicates that certain novels also accrue value in this
fashion. For example, Kraus’s I Love Dick appears in AM, GR, and PR. Reviewers
across these interpretive communities highlight a wide range of literary luminaries
and cultural interlocutors as they assess the generic hybridity of Kraus’s text, which
interweaves highbrow philosophizing with more traditional fictional
characterization. The combined 5-star Goodreads reviews of the novel name drop
Anaïs Nin, Hannah Wilke, Joan Didion, Jack Kerouac, W. G. Sebald, Kate
Zambreno, Eileen Myles, Tom McCarthy, Marcel Proust, and Jacques Lacan, among
other figures. Meanwhile, Elaine Blair’s New Yorker review of the novel alone
references Pierre Marivaux, Gilles Deleuze, Michel Foucault, Paul Virilio, Sheila
Heti, Lena Dunham, Lorde, Jill Soloway, Don DeLillo, Toni Morrison, Philip Roth,
Amy Hempel, Deborah Eisenberg, Mark Leyner, Kathy Acker, Mary Gaitskill, Karl
Ove Knausgård, Ben Lerner, Geoff Dyer, Philip Valdez, Mary McCarthy, Amy
Schumer, Nan Goldin, Simone Weil, and more.64 These findings both suggest the
intersections of these interpretive communities—Kraus’s hybrid text encourages this
kind of reading across all communities—and highlight their differences: even when
a text is densely populated in this fashion across its 5-star Goodreads reviews, it’s
still a far cry less populous than a single laudatory review in PR.
This case study of Kraus’s novel also underscores that these feminist networks are
importantly transhistorical. Blair traces I Love Dick’s reception history from its
largely unnoticed publication in 1997 to its 2013 recuperation by Heti, subsequent
recommendation by Dunham, Instagram feature by singer-songwriter Lorde, and
recent television adaptation. This trajectory suggests how a feminist novel’s
reception reflects individuals’ responses to historical change (Heti to Dunham to
Lorde to TV producers) even in contexts that tend to obscure the reviewer’s own
subjectivity, such as prestige reviews. Yet for all GR’s emphasis on immediate
subjective experience, this interpretive community also engages in a kind of
transhistorical self-erasure by locating novels in historically agnostic or
ambiguously historical genres like feminist sci-fi and feminist dystopian fiction and
65

A C O M P U T A T I O N A L A N A L Y S I S O F I N T E R P R E T I V E C O MM U N I T I E S

identifying novels with blurry historical formulations like second-wave feminism
and feminist radicalism. Once again, relays between individual, idiosyncratic being
and collective life and community belonging are what we talk about when we talk
about feminist fiction.

Imperfect Feminisms
The synthesis of quantitative and qualitative analysis we have undertaken in this
study allows us to explore at scale how reading novels might contribute to feminist
knowledge making, both for individuals and communities. We have seen how each
interpretive community’s discussions of feminist novels grapple with constructions
of personhood in time—through their vocabularies, their modes of self-address, the
rationales they offer for reading feminist novels, and the forms of feminist
subjectivity they promote. In wrestling with these concerns, we argue, readers offer
productive models of feminist reading as a dialogue between personal experience
and social belonging, embodied theory and critical practice, and history as recorded
and as a dynamically unfolding present. These readers establish contemporary
discourse about feminist fiction as both a collective space for imagining prosocial
change and an individual space for recalibrating one’s own feminist value system as
it is lived forward in time.
Just as there are many actively evolving, collectively and individually organized
feminisms, our study’s interpretive communities recognize these novels for their
varied embodiments and articulations of feminism. Read through this lens, even
novels that come up politically short can be politically generative. One social reader
speaks to this dialectical potential when she calls Dietland “disappointing” for “not
promoting a feminism that I’m fond of. It shows a feminism that is not intersectional,
that is often teetering on racist, that condones slut shaming and the villainizing of
sex workers.” Here, “a feminism” implies there is more than one feminism, which
dovetails with literary critics’ use of the term “feminisms” discussed above. Social
readers who speak to this inclusive multiplicity—who cast what they read as both “a
feminist novel” and “not feminist enough”—epitomize a feminist project of active
renewal, wrought by individual and collective grappling with ever-imperfect worlds.

66

J OURNAL OF CU LTURAL A NALYTICS

This dynamic quality of incompletion is a testament to feminist literature’s diverse
interlocutors and their heterogeneous ambitions. Accordingly, there are many
directions that further DH research on feminist literature might pursue. As noted
above, one limitation of our study is that we cannot determine how the dynamics we
observe in these interpretive communities’ discussions of feminist novels might
obtain in other contexts. Future research might therefore explore how these
discussions of feminist novels align with discussions of other kinds of novels in these
same interpretive communities. Alternatively, further research might extend this
analysis to other branches of these interpretive communities (e.g., Amazon customer
reviews, literary monographs) and to other interpretive communities (e.g., paraacademic venues such as Medium, Public Books, popular periodicals such as O, The
Oprah Magazine, Elle). Future scholarship might also examine the interplay
between feminist novels and other modes of feminist literature, such as memoirs,
manifestos, and other non-fiction, in these and other interpretive communities. If
future scholarship is to live up to feminisms’ inclusive ambitions, it will also need
to find creative ways to harness more ephemeral discussions of feminist literature
such as those proliferating on social media sites, individual blogs, and podcasts,
among other fora.
As the generative dissensus across our interpretive communities suggests, reading
feminist novels and discussions thereof does not mean arriving at a final
conclusion—here is feminism, or even here is my feminism—for how could it?
Feminism is an aspirational project of social transformation committed, as
philosopher Noëlle McAfee recently put it, to striving to “know what came before,
be attuned to what is wrong, and act on [the] desire to make things better … for all
people, past, present, and future.”65 This sustained and sustaining work promises to
be always in the making. As we have shown, this work takes place wherever we read
and wherever we talk to others about what we are reading.

In Feminism: A Quick Immersion (2021), philosopher Noëlle McAfee asserts that “there isn’t just one kind of
feminism but a variety of feminist approaches and points of view; but all are trying to make sense of the problem
that, for most of the past three millennia, if not longer, the world over women have been … deprived of the ability to
chart their own life” (New York: Tibidabo Publishing, 2021), 10. Ahmed articulates a similar position both
explicitly and by example, as she offers a series of overlapping definitional statements (e.g., “Feminism: the
dynamism of making connections”; “Feminism: how we survive the consequences of what we come up against by
offering new ways of understanding what we come up against”; “Feminism is DIY: a form of self-assembly”;
“Feminism: on the way to becoming something else” (Living a Feminist Life, 3, 22, 27, 186)). See also Lisa

Barbara Hill Rigney’s Madness and Sexual Politics in the Feminist Novel: Studies in Brontë, Woolf, Lessing, and
Atwood (1978), seemingly the first monograph to employ the key term, avoids defining its eponymous phrase,
instead describing various examples that circle around the broad common ground of heteropatriarchal critique
(Madison: University of Wisconsin Press). Judi M. Roller’s The Politics of the Feminist Novel (1986) takes the
opposite approach, asserting a tight literary definition—“the central character or characters in a feminist novel must
be female and must represent women generally as well as a woman specifically”—and then offering a broad
description of the novel’s ideological commitments: that “human problems are collective as well as individual” and
that “the status of women with relation to [economic, political, and social] structures is that of a minority group”
(Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press), 4-5. Walker’s Feminist Alternatives: Irony and Fantasy in the
Contemporary Novel by Women (1990) refers to “the feminist novel” as “the women’s novel,” defining the latter as
“the essentially realistic novel, as opposed to the popular romance” (Jackson: University Press of Mississippi), 4, 5.
While, for Walker, the women’s novel is not “overtly political,” its “central message is change: the need for social
change and the recognition that social change begins with individual change—the personal is political, but the
reverse is also true” (36). Felski’s Literature After Feminism (2003) offers a more explicit entry into this tradition of
indirection, observing that “many feminist critics are wary of any general claims about women, femininity, or the
female condition” and that “there is not much agreement about the best way to explain the links between gender and
writing” (Chicago: University of Chicago Press), 2.
4

For instance, Felski argues “that it [i]s a mistake to try to define a ‘feminist aesthetic’ or general theory of women
and literature,” asserting, among other things, that a given narrative structure or plot can be “used to argue for
diametrically opposed morals, political theories, or social codes: there is no single ideology frozen in a plotline that
dictates its meaning and use” (Literature After Feminism, 4, 108).

Data for all subcorpora was collected in May and June 2020. Across the four interpretive communities, there are
17 instances of novels in English translation, for example: Ameko Kaeruda’s Sexiled: My Sexist Party Leader
Kicked Me Out, So I Teamed Up With a Mythical Sorceress! translated from the Japanese by Molly Lee in 2020
(from AM); Cho Nam-Joo’s Kim Jiyoung, Born 1982 translated from the Korean by Jamie Chang in 2020 (from
PR); and Charlotte Roche’s Wetlands translated from the German by Tim Mohr in 2010 (from PR).
We excluded interviews from PR because they rarely identified novels as “feminist” or discussed specific novels
vis-à-vis feminism; they more often mentioned feminism in its historical context or individual feminist luminaries.
34

35

Though AM is more heterogenous than the other interpretive communities, its materials all serve a marketing
purpose. Amazon’s famously opaque search algorithms also revealed clear marketing aims; in several cases, the
same novel appeared multiple times in our search results, sometimes under the label “Sponsored” and sometimes
not.

This framework echoes Walsh and Antoniak’s approach to topic modeling as “an interpretive tool,” not “an
objective magic wand” and a tool that involves “significant and subjective decision[s]” such as the number of topics
in each model (“The Goodreads ‘Classics,’” 264).
46

47

We ran full corpus topic models by downsampling and reconfiguring the GR subcorpus to produce word counts
and document numbers in the same order of magnitude across all four subcorpora. We constructed this GR
subcorpus sample by placing reviews of each novel across all five star categories in the same document, yielding 70
documents containing a total of 358,551 words. We then ran a number of topic models using different numbers of
topics and found that the 10-topic model balanced relative coherence of topics with descriptive breadth across our
large and heterogenous corpus.
48

The full GR subcorpus is composed of a selection of 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-star reviews of each of the 70 novels in
this subcorpus. For example, all of the 1-star reviews of Leni Zumas’s Red Clocks (2018) are in one document, and
so on for other star ratings. For Figure 4, we ran a 5-topic model of the 5-star reviews of all 70 novels (70
documents; a total of 921,343 words) and compared it to a 5-topic model of the 1-star reviews of these same 70
novels (again, 70 documents; a total of 617,513 words). We used the MALLET topic model toolkit to measure the
coherence of each topic in both the 1-star and 5-star review models. Coherence measures whether the top terms of a
given topic tend to co-occur together across documents, as Andrew Kachites McCallum explains (“Topic model
diagnostics,” 2018, http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/diagnostics.php). As Mark Algee-Hewitt describes, coherence “can be
used to assess topics for their relative meaningfulness to experts in the field upon which the corpus is based”
(“Computing Criticism,” 13). As log probabilities, coherence scores are negative; the larger the negative value, the
less often the words co-occur (or the less coherent the topic); the closer to zero the value, the more often the words
co-occur (or the more coherent the topic). For the GR 1-star model, the coherence scores are: -221.4674 for topic 0,
-41.8934 for topic 1, -34.8486 for topic 2, -97.3759 for topic 3, and -3.1615 for topic 4. For the GR 5-star model, the
coherence scores are: -49.8547 for topic 0, -5.5319 for topic 1, -131.3004 for topic 2, -24.0985 for topic 3, and
-281.6439 for topic 4. These results echo our qualitative sense that despite the relatively small corpus size (in terms
of number of documents and number of words across those documents), the topics cohere. For more on the utility of
coherence scores and how the measure is calculated, see David Mimno, Hanna M. Wallach, Edmund Talley, Miriam
Leenders, and Andrew McCallum, “Optimizing Semantic Coherence in Topic Models,” Proceedings of the
Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (2011).

Again, we ran a number of topic models on this 40-document subcorpus (composed of one plain text file for each
article) and found that the 10-topic model produced the most coherent and legible set of topics, providing the most
descriptive overview of this collection of documents based on our close reading of the articles.
50

We calculated coherence scores for this topic model according to the method described above. For the LC 10topic model, the coherence scores are: -38.4437 for topic 0, -146.9340 for topic 1, -141.3961 for topic 2, -189.4120
for topic 3, -112.2622 for topic 4, -209.5487 for topic 5, -489.2012 for topic 6, -306.6074 for topic 7, -40.3141 for

topic 8, and -204.1436 for topic 9. Again, these results support our qualitative sense that despite the relatively small
size of the LC subcorpus, the topics cohere.
Sarah Allison, Marissa Gemma, Ryan Heuser, Franco Moretti, Amir Tevel, and Irena Yamboliev, “Style at the
Scale of the Sentence,” Pamphlets of the Stanford Literary Lab 5 (2013): 10. The MDW method developed at the
Literary Lab is one of several methods that attempt to determine which words are significantly more important in
one set of documents of a large corpus than another. For example, Christof Schöch et al. have compellingly explored
John Burrows’ Zeta, “a measure of distinctiveness or keyness” (Christof Schöch, Daniel Schlör, Albin Zehe,
Henning Gebhard, Martin Becker, and Andreas Hotho, “Burrows’ Zeta: Exploring And Evaluating Variants And
Parameters,” DH 2018, https://dh2018.adho.org/en/burrows-zeta-exploring-and-evaluating-variants-andparameters/). Both Burrows’ Zeta and the Literary Lab’s MDW method are informed by TF-IDF (term frequencyinverse document frequency), a measure used in many systems of modern information retrieval. For more on the
latter, see Ho Chung Wu, Robert Wing Pong Luk, Kam Fai Wong, and Kui Lam Kwok, “Interpreting TF-IDF Term
Weights as Making Relevance Decisions,” ACM Transactions on Information Systems 26, no. 3 (June 2008).
Each of these methods of determining distinctiveness has limitations. Weighing these factors, which we
gloss below, we use the Literary Lab’s MDW method and take additional steps to mitigate its drawbacks. As the
MDW method is sensitive to frequency, it requires imposing some constraints. For example, since very rare words,
especially those that show up only in one group of documents, are overweighted by the algorithm, we have imposed
a minimum frequency of 5 appearances to avoid capturing a word that appears only a few times as exceptionally
highly distinctive. Stopwords usually show up as significant due to their high frequency, so we have removed them
from our analysis. The MDW method valuably attaches a significance score to each result (having established a
threshold for significance through the Fisher’s exact test), by contrast to TF-IDF and Burrows’ Zeta, which create a
score that can rank distinctiveness but do not assign it a significance without further testing. We attend to this
significance score, read for trends in groups of related distinctive words to avoid placing undue interpretive weight
on our selections, and synthesize our close readings of the results with those of the other methods we employ.

This social reader here evokes the Argentinian cultural critic Flavia Dzodan’s viral assertion: “My feminism will
be intersectional or it will be bullshit!” (Tiger Beatdown, October 10, 2011,
http://tigerbeatdown.com/2011/10/10/my-feminism-will-be-intersectional-or-it-will-be-bullshit/). Social readers also
engage this terminology to evaluate novels for their feminist relevance over time. One subset of these assessments
considers whether a novel previously identified as feminist remains feminist by contemporary standards. For
instance, a 3-star reviewer of Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre asks, “Was it feminist? Yes. But was it feminist enough
for a woman of today? In my honest opinion, no.” A 5-star reviewer disagrees, arguing that the character Jane is “a
feminist for all ages.” While some social readers say they feel like a bad feminist for rating certain novels poorly,

there is nonetheless a pervasive sense that certain “feminist classics”—from Herland (1915) to Joanna Russ’s The
Female Man (1975)—haven’t aged well. Yet social readers do not confine their disapproval to authors past. A 2-star
reviewer calls The Penelopiad “a testament to the generational differences between more traditional feminists, like
Margaret Atwood, and feminists in my own age group.” While the timeless/retrograde opposition situates novels
along a historical axis of reception, these commentaries also establish a more subjective axis of viable models of
feminist value systems, which readers recalibrate in a self-reflexive process of articulating the feminism they aspire
to live.

Many social readers critique this tautological capitalist logic (e.g., “you should buy this because others have
bought it”), warning “Just don’t believe the hype!” (from a 1-star review of Their Eyes Were Watching God).

In a parallel vein, Tara K. Menon argues that ambivalence does not necessarily serve a feminist agenda in novels
“unless it is undergirded by fundamental feminist principles” (“What Women Want,” Public Books, June 24, 2020,
https://www.publicbooks.org/what-women-want/).
PR’s MDW results seem to aggregate patterns from other subcorpora, much like PR documents appear in the
midst of AM and GR on the PCA biplot. For example, “pleasure” (obs = 36, p-value = 0.009911452, odds-ratio = 2)
is distinctive of PR but evokes GR’s commitment to the embodied reading experience in more formal language,
while “latest” (obs = 16, p-value = 0.026234952, odds-ratio = 2.666666667) and “current” (obs = 29, p-value =
0.024374837, odds-ratio = 1.933333333) suggest AM’s consumer-oriented impulses. Meanwhile, “complicated”
(obs = 19, p-value = 0.026114042, odds-ratio = 2.375), “ambitious” (obs = 19, p-value = 0.026114042, odds-ratio =
2.375), and “seems” (obs = 91, p-value = 0.00916838, odds-ratio = 1.491803279) echo LC’s and GR’s respective
registrations of complexity. The word “ambivalence” itself appears in the LC, GR, and PR subcorpora and is not
distinctive of any one of them.
