The article analyzes the relationship between gender and taste at Shakespeare
and Company. Using the Shakespeare and Company Project datasets, we
discover that the majority of the books in the lending library were by men, and
that women were almost twice as likely as men to borrow books by women. We
also discover that the female authors with a high ratio of male to female readers
are now canonical: Agatha Christie, Emily Dickinson, Gertrude Stein,
Marianne Moore. In contrast, the female authors with the highest ratio of
female to male readers are less well-known: Margaret Kennedy, E. M. Delafield,
Rebecca West, Elizabeth von Arnim. These final two discoveries are surprising:
they suggest that the reading practices of men determined the canon of female
authors, and that the reading practices of women might reveal a counterfactual
canon of modernism. We consider how this counterfactual canon of female
authors might influence future work in literary history.

Although celebrated for its support of male modernists—James Joyce, Ernest
Hemingway, Ezra Pound—Shakespeare and Company was run by and mostly
for women. Sylvia Beach opened the bookshop and lending library in 1919,
inspired by her romantic partner, Adrienne Monnier, who owned the French1
language bookshop and lending library, La maison des amis des livres.
Beach’s assistants were all women: Myrsine Moschos, Margaret Newitt,
Eleanor Oldenberger, Paulette Lévy, Ruth Camp—to name only a few. The
majority of the lending library’s members were also women: writers, teachers,
students, governesses, aristocrats, artists, tourists, homemakers. Finally,
women were responsible for the majority of the lending library’s
circulation—due, in part, to the borrowing activity of two voracious readers,
Alice M. Killen and France Emma Raphaël.
We wrote this article to better understand the relationship between gender
and taste at Shakespeare and Company. Inspired by Melanie Micir’s
description of Beach’s record keeping as a “queer feminist modernist
practice,” we wanted to learn more about the composition of the lending

1 “Shakespeare and Company was built on Sylvia’s connections with other women,” Caitlin O’Keefe contends; “Her mother, Eleanor, wired

Sylvia money from her savings to start her business; Monnier helped Sylvia find a location for the shop, and then helped her build her base
of French readers” (O’Keefe, “Secret Feminist History”).

library’s holdings and the borrowing practices of its members (88). What
percentage of the lending library’s holdings were by women? How likely were
men to read books by women, and vice versa? Did men and women prefer
different authors? The datasets from the Shakespeare and Company Project
promised to help address these questions.
As we conducted our research, we remained alert to the limitations of our
inquiry. We were wary of overstating the importance of gender—as if a
single attribute could explain the reading preferences of an entire community.
We were also wary of essentializing the categories “man” and “woman”—as
if a person must be one or the other. Shakespeare and Company was a
community of women, but it was also a community that challenged and
transformed gender norms. Finally, we were wary of misgendering
individuals. The Shakespeare and Company Project datasets use first names
and titles from Beach’s records to identify the gender of lending library
members. The Virtual International Authority File (VIAF) identifies the
3
gender of published writers. Neither resource is perfect. With these
limitations front and center, we analyzed the datasets and created an
additional one of our own.
Three findings emerged from our research. First, we discovered that the
vast majority of books in the library were by men. Second, we learned that
women were almost twice as likely as men to borrow books by women.
These findings led to a third. The female authors with the highest ratio of
male to female readers constituted a recognizable canon: Agatha Christie,
Emily Dickinson, Gertrude Stein, Marianne Moore. In contrast, the female
authors with the highest ratio of female to male readers were much less
familiar: Margaret Kennedy, E. M. Delafield, Rebecca West, Elizabeth von
Arnim, Mary Borden, Kay Boyle. This third finding was startling and led to
additional questions. Did the preferences of men predict or even determine
the nineteenth- and twentieth-century canon, including the recovery projects
that redefined it in the 1970s and 1980s? Could we use the preferences
of the women at Shakespeare and Company to identify a counterfactual
canon of modernism? At this stage of our research, the finding is closer to
a provocation than an argument, but it challenges assumptions about the
formation and reproduction of the modernist canon, and presents a new
agenda for modernist studies: how would modernist studies change if we
began talking about a “von Arnim Era”?

2 O’Keefe makes a similar claim, arguing that Shakespeare and Company fused Beach’s “literary and feminist visions” (O’Keefe, “Secret

Feminist History”).

Figure 1. Members and borrows by gender.

To begin our research, we used the Shakespeare and Company Project datasets
to reveal the gender demographics of the lending library membership. The
datasets identify the gender of 4,039 members—sixty-two percent of whom
4
were women (Kotin et al., “Lending Library Members”). Of the 20,518
borrows by members with identified genders, 16,022 were by women—over
seventy percent (fig. 1). These numbers more-or-less match the findings of
Joshua Kotin and Rebecca Sutton Koeser in their article about the most
popular books at Shakespeare and Company, which used a previous version
of the datasets.
To discover the gender distribution of the authors of the lending library
holdings, we had to create our own dataset. We reconciled the author names
in the Shakespeare and Company Project datasets with gender information
from VIAF. We limited our analysis to single-authored books. This dataset
ultimately included 5,075 books—79.5 percent of which were written by
men. As we considered this number, we worried about the influence of
canonical literature. When Beach began to collect books for the lending
library, she visited bookshops around Paris and bought all the inexpensive
English-language books she could find—mostly canonical literature. She
collected 1,012 books in all, only 107 of which were by women, eleven

4 The dataset does not identify the gender of 1,196 lending library members; accordingly we excluded these members in our analysis. One

lending library member—Claude Cahun—is identified as non-binary. For a discussion of the incompleteness of Shakespeare and Company
Project data, see Koeser and LeBlanc, “Missing Data, Speculative Reading,” in this special feature.

percent (“Volumes”). To mitigate the influence of these purchases—and the
gender-imbalance of canonical literature in general—we identified a subset
of contemporary literature: 3,684 books published between 1919 and 1941.
These holdings were still dominated by men, although to a slightly lesser
extent: seventy-five percent (fig. 2).
To contextualize these percentages, we examined the holdings of Princeton
University Library. Princeton holds 6,757 novels published between 1919 and
1941: seventy percent were written by men and nineteen percent by women.
(The authors of the remaining novels either do not have VIAF numbers
or gender information in VIAF.) We also analyzed other genres—poetry,
6
philosophy, history, psychology—and the percentages held. For additional
context, we compared the most popular books at Shakespeare and Company
to bestseller lists from the period. Six of the top ten most frequently
borrowed books at Shakespeare and Company were by men—sixty percent
(Kotin and Koeser). The percentage corresponds to the percentage of books
by men on the Publishers Weekly bestseller lists between 1919 and 1941.

5 Of the 1,012 books, 844 are single-author works by men and 107 are single-author works by women. The remaining sixty-one books are

periodicals, edited collections, or co-authored volumes. We thank Eli Mandel for creating a spreadsheet with these books.

books held by the Library of Congress, and on Amazon and Goodreads, see Ekstrand and Kluver, “Exploring Author Gender,” p. 381.

On those lists, 363 out of 549 books—sixty-six percent—were written by
7
men. By these measures, the gender demographics of the Shakespeare and
8
Company lending library holdings were fairly conventional.
Next, we focused on the borrowing practices of lending library members.
How often did men read books by women? The answer is dismaying but
unsurprising: not very often. Of the total borrows by men, only fifteen
9
percent were books written by women. In contrast, thirty percent of the
borrows by women were of women authors—a percentage that corresponds
to the gender distribution of the lending library’s holdings. Men, it seems,
actively avoided reading books by women, whereas women simply didn’t seek
out such books.
What about the kinds of books that men and women read? The top five
female authors are the same for both men and women, although women seem
to have preferred literary fiction to crime fiction, while men valued the genres
equally. Virginia Woolf, Dorothy Richardson, Katherine Mansfield, Dorothy
L. Sayers, and Christie are popular among both groups. Divergences begin to
appear further down the lists. While men were reading Pearl S. Buck, Stein,
Edith Sitwell, and George Eliot, women were reading Kennedy, Boyle, and
Delafield (table 1).
To push our analysis further, we identified the most polarizing authors at
Shakespeare and Company. Since the total number of borrows by women
is more than twice that of men, we first had to find a fair way to compare
borrowing preferences. For each author, we calculated a percentage based on

7 See “Publishers Weekly Lists.” Wikipedia cites Hackett and Burke, 80 Years of Bestsellers.
8 By other measures, the holdings were unconventional: the lending library stocked important, controversial books by women—from

Radclyffe Hall’s The Well of Loneliness (1926) to Djuna Barnes’s Nightwood (1936), and from Marie Stopes’s Married Love, or Love in
Marriage (1918) to Margaret Sanger’s My Fight for Birth Control (1931).
9 Sieghart analyzes the numbers today: “For the top 10 bestselling female authors,” she writes, “only 19% of their readers are men.” See

Sieghart, “Why.”

the total borrows by each demographic group. For example, the 252 borrows
of Woolf by women represent six percent of the total borrows by women,
while the forty-three borrows of Woolf by men represent 5.2 percent of the
total borrows by men. We then calculated the difference between the two
percentages—the delta score—for each author. The results reveal the most
polarizing authors (tables 2 and 3).
To represent these results in a visual format, we provide a chart showing the
most polarizing authors. (Rebecca Sutton Koeser designed and implemented
the chart.) The figure below indicates the total borrow percentage of each
author for both women (on the left, in orange) and men (on the right, in
turquoise). The black line traces the delta between the borrow percentages.
The authors most preferred by women have positive deltas, while the authors
most preferred by men have negative deltas (fig. 3).
What can we learn from these results? First, members of the lending library
agreed on which men to read, but not which women. The authors with the
highest deltas are almost always women. Except for Henry James (preferred
by men) and Hugh Walpole (preferred by women), all the remaining authors
in the top ten for both groups are women. (Interestingly, Shakespeare has

a delta score near zero.) Second, male members, unlike female members,
overwhelmingly preferred crime writers and women authors who
eventually—belatedly—became canonical: George Eliot, Dickinson, Moore,
Stein. (Christie is likely the most canonical author of genre fiction.) The
only canonical female author on the list of authors preferred by women is
Woolf—and she was also popular among men, as the top ten lists indicate.
These results suggest that the preferences of men at Shakespeare and
Company not only predicted (and perhaps helped to determine) the canon
of nineteenth and twentieth-century literature, but the recovery projects that
redefined it as well. At the same time, the results offer a way to see (and
read) beyond this canon: to identify a counterfactual canon that reflects the
actual preferences of women readers and the influence of women authors.
This counterfactual canon has the potential to inspire new recovery projects
and histories of modernism.
What if we were to start reading Kennedy, Delafield, West, von Arnim, Boyle,
and Borden alongside Joyce, Woolf, D. H. Lawrence, and Ernest Hemingway?
How would this new canon change our understanding of modernism? What
would we learn about recovery projects and their imbrication in long histories
of power and oppression? How might such a canon lead to new accounts of
artistic innovation?
Some accounts are already there to discover. A recent special issue of the
journal Women highlights von Arnim’s invention of a new kind of “hybrid
writing, which moves deftly between outright social satire, the diary form,
the country-house novel, the (uneasy) romance and, occasionally, the Gothic”

(Maddison et al. 3–4). The issue also describes her experiments in
“autoeroticism” and her “proto-feminist . . . portrayal of women’s
experience” that is at once “radical” and “pessimistic about possibilities for
change” (O’Connell 22; Turner 56). Discussing Borden’s novels, Steven Biel
and Lauren Kaminsky argue that her “experiments with anonymity and
interchangeability—unlike more canonical modernist forays into interiority
and individuation—make the Great War seem new and razor-sharp.” Writing
about Boyle, Julie Goodspeed-Chadwick identifies her creation of a “feminist
avant-garde” (52). What other innovations has modernist studies missed?
More important: what innovations might modernist studies now identify?
This is one of the most vital aspects of quantitative approaches to literary
study: the ability to identify new questions and thus new research
programs—programs that evade the assumptions that define established fields
of study.
