Culture is a nuanced term that is hard to define conclusively. It is largely used
to refer to the totality of values, basic assumptions and life orientations, beliefs,
policies, procedures, and codes of conduct. These are shared by a group of
people and affect their behavior and the way they lead their lives. Cultural
Analytics (CA), as a field, examines vast amounts of cultural data (books,
images, newspapers, music, literature, etc.) to derive culturally relevant insights.
Various methods and techniques (natural language processing, network analysis,
visualization, and data mining) are applied to cultural components so that they
are useful for research in the humanities. CA can help identify the behavioral
components of human cultures and provide an accurate insight into the degree
to which people conform to the current or target culture. It utilizes the
corpora, metadata, and tools of text and image analysis to provide meaningful
insights into the subject of research.
This special issue explores how we can improve current performance in terms of
understanding Arab cultural and social change and how we can implement
behavioral changes or transformations more smoothly. The papers in this
special issue use digitized printed texts, including books, journals, and printed
ephemera to expand our knowledge of the key players in the printed world
during a crucial period of modern Arab history. The combination of these
sources will illuminate the intellectual trajectories of those who produced such
texts and their transnational formal and informal networks.

The Potential and Limits of Arabic Digital Humanities

Cultural Analytics enables scholars to conduct research on unprecedented
quantitative scales, but the vast digitized Arabic corpus has largely gone
untapped. Most of the research projects in Digital Humanities have focused
on Western Europe and the Americas, tools having been developed and
mainly trained to handle the Latin scripts. This gap between the Arabic
text corpus and CA is in fact part of a wider gap between Western and
non-Western CA, making this project both an exercise in catching-up and a
pioneering foray into uncharted waters.
This special issue came as the outcome of a research project I led and is titled
“The Computational Study of Culture: Cultural Analytics for Modern Arab
and Muslim Studies,” which was funded by Qatar National Research Fund,
National Priorities Program cycle no. 10. The project uses Cultural Analytics
(CA) approaches to digitize and annotate a large archive of machine-readable
Arabic language cultural texts from the nineteenth century to today to make
these documents useful for digital humanities research. It manages to digitize
and annotate a set of early Arabic media material from the late 19th century
until now. These sources include the magazines of Al-Manar, Al-Risala, AlMuqtabas and Al-Machriq. The project manages to capture, for example,
through topic modelling, a main representational paradigm framing identity
formation during the inter-war and post-War Egypt, with a specific reference
to the journalistic articles in Al-Manar and Al-Risala, the two leading and
most effective platforms at the time. We approach the identitarian discursive
practices as a cultural continuum, rather than separate moments in AraboIslamic Egyptian history. Through a blending of digital (distant) reading and
close analytical reading of articles addressing the topic, we try to nuance the
almost settled readings of both luminary figures in the Arab Nahda through
broadening the perspective.
A corpus of 2.3 billion words comprising 9000 books and 5 newspapers and
magazines has been compiled. A subset of this corpus has been annotated
for morphological segmentation, part of speech tagging, named entity
recognition and sentiment analysis. The annotated corpus is used for building
predictive models. The approach we employed in our research is both
quantitative and qualitative. At the quantitative level, we use tools and
algorithms from computational linguistics, data mining, and information
extraction to extract useful information from our corpus. This information is
then used to build a graph that is used for network analysis. The qualitative
side of the analysis makes use of the graph extracted in the first step, to gain,
and provide, meaningful insights that can be used in the historical and sociopolitical aspect of the project.
Drawing on computational analysis or topic modelling, we thus probe
relevant thematic discussions on the conceptualization of race, language,
culture and identity by leading Arab-Islamic intelligentsia at a foundational
moment that paved the way for Arab modernity. Here, topic modelling

serves as a statistical tool for handling big data that is almost impossible to
process through conventional methods (here thousands of pages of both AlManar and Al-Risala). It involves segmenting texts, revealing their underlying
cultural patterns, through calculation of specific topic models, measurement
of topical associations or regularities and capturing coherence values, all
coupled with interpretation of valence and quality through conventional
close readings. So, it is used in identifying variables or features in social
science models. In other words, it is a tool for amplified reading or seeing
large themes in a massive group of texts; we are speaking about thousands
of pages, that are almost impossible to read individually. Although we realize
the ongoing challenge in the field to examine complex ideas like colonialism,
nationalism or racism through distant and close readings, given the intrinsic
difficulty of pinpointing such slippery or nuanced terms, however, the
capability to generalize across substantially broader aspects of culture is
crucial. Still, we believe that – through blending the empirical and the
theoretical and through the analytical lens of our close readings – such
a tool can help in detecting the underlying patterns and collective frames
surrounding the issues under discussion. At least, it helps in giving
indications and thus sustaining specific anticipations about the future of
such discourses and their consequent realities on the ground. It is so far an
optimum tool in addressing big data; we are speaking about thousands of
pages that are almost impossible to handle manually within a reasonable span
of time.

The project seeks to bridge the Arabic part of the gap by building on the
expertise of NLeSC and CLARIAH to develop a set of basic and more
advanced tools for Arabic text-mining and computational analysis, to be
used in our project case studies. The platform developed by this project is
the first smart one in Arabic. It hosts hundreds of thousands of materials.
Being vast and smart, the project’s platform is expected to be a unique
resource for researchers in the humanities and social sciences. One major
advantage of the platform is that much of the current qualitative research
in the humanities will turn (at least partially) quantitative. Instead of doing
research on a small scale, researchers can now make use of a large dataset
with unique annotation. Adding metadata to the platform is the single most
important and challenging part. While a collection may be useful in its
own, an annotated collection is far more superior as it lends itself easily to
questions never considered before.
The project made a major contribution to comparative cultural studies that
critically re-evaluate the place of the West in relation to “the East,” and
vice versa. Theoretically, and by applying a transcultural lens that highlights
the critical fault lines in canonical, Western-centric concepts and theories,
this project constituted an attempt to intervene significantly in previously
Western-dominated debates regarding a range of foundational concepts: race/
ethnicity, the public sphere, social movements, citizenship, collective memory,
and identity, among others. Methodologically, the project is profoundly
collaborative, deploying the expertise of a number of scholars from different
continents and disciplinary traditions. And empirically, this project made a
major contribution to public and scholarly knowledge through collection and
curation of archival material through digital methods.
This special issue explores how we can improve current performance in terms
of understanding Arab cultural and social change and how we can implement
behavioural changes or transformations more smoothly. The articles in this
special issue use digitized printed texts, including books, journals, and printed
ephemera to expand our knowledge of the key players in the printed world
during a crucial period of modern Arab history. The combination of these
sources will illuminate the intellectual trajectories of those who produced
such texts and their transnational formal and informal networks.
This special issue is highly multidisciplinary by nature. It combines the efforts
of researchers from the fields of humanities, social science, and computational
linguistics, bringing together scholars with unique expertise and skills in the
field of Arabic digital humanities to expand the current state of knowledge
for researchers in fields of history, cultural studies, sociology, and the arts.
The aim is to bring together professionals to discuss their ongoing project
paradigms. Examples of their work will be examined for their efficiency and

added value to knowledge in their fields of study related to Arab culture to
map out the trends and fluctuations that enable us to better understand this
current phenomena in Arab culture today.
Culture can act as an archetypal example or pattern that provides a model for
the disparate parts and brings them together to form a harmonious whole.
In this way, a culture is created that is imposed by one group or community
on another. The concept of culture varies, however, from an Eliotean “whole
way of life” to an Arnoldean acquaintance “with the best that has been
known and said in the world, and thus with the history of the human spirit.”
In his book, The Machine in the Garden, Leo Marx argues the centrality of
American “high” culture to the sustenance of human values.
This special issue uses the theoretical framework described above to look at
the minorities in the Arab world (especially in Egypt) and the cultural and
political constructions of empire. Some of the articles in this issue analyze
their approaches and their arguments about the nature and functioning of
hegemony and/or imperialist logic. They use computational tools to explore
the role of culture in this, and how Arab Jews, for example, differ in their
models and approaches. As indicated by Edward W. Said in Culture and
Imperialism, the totality of race, gender, class, etc. constitute the main
constituent factors of culture, and empire as a political and economic entity.
More specifically, Said links the above-mentioned phases of culture, literature,
and the intelligentsia to colonization and racism. Literary and artistic works as
cultural products are linked to society in general in the past or in the present.
Such a critical context helps in unraveling and nuancing the concepts of
culture, language, and race in Arab Nahḍah discourse within framework of
collective identity discourses. This includes a discussion of the representation
ethnic minorities (particularly the Jews) as embedded in this discourse of
collective Arab identity, in comparison to the discourse of race and racism.
This perspective acknowledges a broader sense of racial discrimination that is
not limited to essentialist prejudice or discrimination predicated on biological
differences but expands the taxonomy of race to include prejudice or
discrimination based on cultural differences. Indeed, such culture(religion)based prejudice is inseparable from racism, knowing that sometimes cultural
and color racism are intertwined when cultural identity is a marker of
race (Islamic, Christian/Coptic, and Jewish). So, the discourse of racialism
is embedded in cultural and economic sociology which are as essential as
the biological element itself. In his definition of the constituents of racism
in Britain, Tariq Modood notes that “in the long history of racism it is
nineteenth-century biologism that is the exception, and certainly Europe’s
oldest racisms, anti-Semitism and Islamophobia, are culturalist.” These racial
manifestations shall be discussed as engaged in Rashid Riḍā’s al-Manār and
Aḥmad Hassan al-Zayyāt’s al-Risālah. Both magazines are selected for articles
in this Special Issue due to their significance as platforms for two leading

revivalist projects, Islamism and liberalism, and to their reconciliatory/
hybridist approach that lent itself to conflicting ideologies in the Arab world
of their time as well as today. The relevance of the works of Riḍā and alZayyāt is reflected in the fact that they are still invoked as influential figures by
both the Salafis and the secularists, or the traditionalists and the progressive
modernists in the major discourse on Arab identity.
Here it becomes essential to explore the role of “organic” intellectuals (to
brorrow from Gramsci), in confronting cultural imperialism and maintaining
native language and culture to counter the hegemonic culture of the empire.
Such intellectuals help in unravelling this intricate web of identities against
the troubling process of racialization that disconnect minorities from their
cultural citizenship. A relevant example is the pervasive racial profiling of
the Jews within Arab intellectual and cultural circles which involves a
convergence that blurs the lines between reality and perception. Arab Jews
undergo a comparable process of racialization, which raises fundamental
questions about belonging and citizenship. This racialization in Egypt,
fundamentally flawed in its epistemological underpinnings, stems from a
skewed interpretation of citizenship within diverse Arab societies. In this
context, we assert that the concept of transcultural citizenship emerges as an
empowering framework that defines belonging based on lived experiences. It
defies the challenges of Islamophobia in the United States, whether driven
by racialized nationalism or restrictive multiculturalism. Consequently,
transculturality becomes a tool of resistance for minority subjectivity,
countering the state’s hegemonic subjectification (in the Foucauldian sense).
This definition aligns with the transnational context of anthropologist Aihwa
Ong’s notion of cultural citizenship, a dual process of self-realization and
external shaping within the realms of power connected to the nation-state
and civil society. Furthermore, it extends Sunaina Maira‘s concept of “flexible
citizenship,” a manifestation that responds to shifts in the institution of
citizenship within nation-states and changing power dynamics on both
national and global scales. Arab Jewish transcultural identity emerges
organically, albeit not without critical self-examination of its limitations. It
reflects Arab Jews’ complex attitude toward the Arab world, where they
navigate a paradoxical relationship with their Jewish heritage while
simultaneously embracing it. In essence, this narrative underscores the
potential of transculturality to foster change by fostering dialogue and
conversation, acting as a potential remedy for both external colonization and
local extremism. Only through these interactions can we truly envision and
enact meaningful transformations.
In the pre-Nahḍah era, magazines were the locomotive of cultural change
and enlightenment in an Arab world suffering from both vicious colonialism
and oppressive monarchy. These magazines brought dynamism to a largely
stagnant Arabo-Islamic world. They also served as a platform not only for

Journal of Cultural Analytics

The Potential and Limits of Arabic Digital Humanities

interreligious dialogues, debates and disputes, but also for a diverse process
of translating world literature. No wonder that major intellectuals of the
time contributed to these magazines and added to their lively and innovative
discussions. Both al-Manār and then al-Risālah played key roles in reflecting
the spirit of their times and in enlivening the cultural sphere in Egypt and
relatively in the rest of the Arab Islamic world, given their circularity outside
Egypt. Here, the cultural analytical approach, which focuses on the emerging
collective patterns, is consistent with the emerging collective sense of identity
observed during the recent Arab uprisings that swept the Arab world a decade
ago.
Egypt was witnessing a situation of cultural upheaval triggered by the
emergence of dynamic cultural journalism. Magazines were the fulcrum of
change, in literary and cultural tastes, reflecting the mood of the times, and
of course broadening the base of the reading public and driving the process
of modernization. Magazines then, largely driven by individual projects,
defied institutionalization, in the Foucauldian sense, and – by developing
autonomy – served as an arena for creativity and accelerated cultural change.
Both Riḍā and al-Zayyāt assumed an all-encompassing hybridist discourse
that transcended the dilemmatic binaries in religion, culture and politics
of the time. Riḍā, for example, did not follow any particular school of
jurisprudence but was – to quote Leor Halevi in Modern Things on Trial –
eclectic in his “laissez-faire Salafism.” Similarly, al-Zayyāt was an advocate of
multiculturalism and literary syncretism, particularly through his translations
of English and French canonical literature into Arabic.
It should be noted, however, that the two journals, like the Nahḍah project
in the Arab world, which was nipped in the bud, were individual initiatives
that were discontinued with the death of their owners and main editors. Here
springs the felicity of the revival of their legacy through the current project.
The two men, Riḍā and al-Zayyāt, dreamed of an Arabo-Islamic world united
under a common roof. For Riḍā, this was initially the Ottoman Caliphate.
Then, after the rise of radical and purist movements, such as Pan-Turanism
and Pan-Turkism, the project of Ottoman-led Pan-Islamism gave way to a
kind of Arab Pan-Islamism. Interestingly, Riḍā’s Arab Pan-Islamism was itself
a nativist version of Islam in the face of a then emerging Pharaonic or Coptic
nationalism, not to mention liberalism or secularism.
The article by Umar Ryad and Emad Mohamed titled, “A Topic Modelling of
Muslim Religious Reform in the Colonial Age: A Computational and Digital
Study of al-Manār (1898-1935)” serves as a test case illustrating the synergies
between computational sciences and Islamic and Arabic studies in addressing
cultural, religious, and historical inquiries pertaining to the Arab and Muslim
world. The central focus revolves around exploring computational methods
to systematically trace, quantify, and explicate the evolution of religious
concerns within the renowned Muslim reformist journal, al-Manār

(Lighthouse). This journal was published by the influential Muslim reformer
Muhammad Rashīd Riḍā (1865-1935) from 1898 to 1935 in Cairo. The
methodology employed encompasses both quantitative and qualitative
approaches, utilizing the al-Manār-corpus. Morphological processing and
topic modelling techniques are applied to analyze thematic co-occurrences of
topics and lexemes relevant to Muslim thought and societies during Riḍā’s
era. Through this interdisciplinary framework, the paper aims to shed light
on the computational tools’ efficacy in unraveling and understanding the
nuanced development of religious reformist discourse as encapsulated in
the pages of al-Manār. The exploration of these methods provides a novel
perspective on the intersection of computational sciences and Islamic and
Arabic studies in unraveling cultural and historical dimensions.
Eid Mohamed and Talaat Mohamed in their article titled, “Racio-national
Imaginary and Discursive Formation of Arabo-Islamic Identity in al-Manār
and al-Risālah: An LDA Topic Modeling Study” delves into the intricacies
of culture, language, and race, serving as pivotal elements in the discourse
surrounding Pan-Islamist/Pan-Arabist national identification in Egypt during
a period of profound transformation in the political and social landscape,
setting the groundwork for the subsequent century. The methodology
employed adopts a computational analysis approach, leveraging topic
modeling to delve into thematic discussions that revolve around the
conceptualization of race, language, culture, and identity by prominent ArabMuslim intelligentsia. This exploration unfolds during a foundational
moment that laid the groundwork for the Arab Nahḍah or modernity.
The focus of the analysis is on tracing the intellectual development within
the writings of two key figures: Muḥammad Rashīd Riḍā (1865-1935),
whose works featured prominently in the magazine he edited, al-Manār
(The Lighthouse, 1898-1935), and Aḥmad Ḥassan al-Zayyāt (1885-1968),
the editor of al-Risālah (The Message, 1933-1953), a weekly magazine, both
based in Cairo, Egypt. The study reveals that both figures aimed to foster
a predominantly hybridized discourse, encompassing Islamist and Arabist
perspectives, as manifested in the clustered paradigms of modeled topics.
Ultimately, the analysis contributes to a deeper understanding of the
intellectual landscape during this transformative era in Egyptian history.
The primary objective of the article titled, “Gender-Based Conceptual
Reasoning Detection for the Cultural Arabic Text” by Raheem Sarwar and
Emad Mohamed, is to explore the distinctions in queries raised by individuals
of different genders within a religious context. Additionally, they aim to
discern whether it is feasible to forecast the popularity of answers and identify
the factors contributing to answer popularity. Their methodology involves
the creation of a novel dataset comprising 40,000 questions and answers,
annotated with gender and popularity details sourced from online questionanswering platforms. Employing advanced Arabic text pre-processing
techniques, they extensively employ machine learning algorithms in their
Journal of Cultural Analytics

8

The Potential and Limits of Arabic Digital Humanities

experimental studies for two main tasks: predicting asker gender and
forecasting answer popularity. Their investigation also extends to thematic
gender variation analysis, addressing crucial research questions that augment
current knowledge. Specifically, they delve into understanding the disparities
between questions posed by women and men, explore the automated
classification of questions based on gender, and assess the predictability of
fatwa popularity, unraveling the elements contributing to the popularity of
a fatwa. The outcome of their experimental analysis showcases promising
results: they achieve a 98% accuracy in predicting gender, a minimal Mean
Absolute Error in predicting views (popularity), and an insightful
identification of topics and their associations, elucidating their gender-related
relevance. To further contribute to the research community, the authors
intend to make the dataset and source code publicly accessible.
The article titled, “Neither Corpus Nor Edition: Building a Pipeline to
Make Data Analysis Possible on Medieval Arabic Commentary Traditions”
by Cornelis van Lit and Dirk Roorda, enriches the issue through developing a
suite of Python tools specifically tailored for the efficient analysis of text reuse
and intertextuality within a distinct category of medieval Arabic texts, namely
commentaries available in print. Their process involves taking these printed
editions, scanning them, pre-processing the images, running them through an
OCR engine, cleaning the output, and organizing it into a data structure that
mirrors the explicit intertextual relationships among the texts. Subsequently,
they conduct extensive data analysis using these structured datasets. In the
realm of digital approaches to medieval Arabic texts, existing methods have
predominantly fallen into two categories. On one hand, the authors have
the micro-level approach, commonly referred to as a ‘digital edition,’ where
individual texts are digitally represented with dense annotations, typically
in TEI-XML. On the other hand, there’s the macro-level approach, termed
a ‘digital corpus,’ comprising thousands of loosely encoded and sparsely
annotated plain text files. These two approaches differ significantly in scale,
with the micro-level dealing with tens of thousands of words designed
primarily for human readability, and the macro-level extending to over a
billion words, prioritizing machine readability. In their pursuit, the authors
have aimed to establish a meso-level of digital analysis—neither strictly an
edition nor a corpus. This involves dealing with a group of texts ranging
from hundreds of thousands to millions of words. Striking a balance, the
authors allow for a small but perceptible margin of error, incorporating light
annotations geared towards machine readability. This approach maintains
opportunities for visual inspection and manual correction. In this paper,
the authors elucidate the rationale behind our methodology, highlight the
technical achievements it has yielded, and share the results obtained thus far.
Mai Zaki and Emad Mohamed, in their article titled “Two translations of
Mahfouz’s Awlad Haratina (Children of the Alley): A computational-stylistic
analysis”, embark on a comparative exploration of two English translations
Journal of Cultural Analytics

The Potential and Limits of Arabic Digital Humanities

of Naguib Mahfouz’s contentious novel,, Awlad Haratina (Children of Our
Alley), employing computational-stylistic analysis. The objective is twofold:
firstly, to demonstrate how quantifiable computational and distant reading
techniques can unveil patterns of stylistic disparities between the two
translations, and secondly, to contextualize these findings within the broader
societal backdrop surrounding the English translations by Stewart (1981) and
Theroux (1996) of this renowned modern Arabic novel. The outcomes of the
analysis reveal distinctive linguistic patterns in each translation, underscoring
variations in lexical variety and richness, sentence structure, readability level,
and stylometric aspects, along with certain lexical choices. These results
provide valuable insights when interpreted within the social milieu
surrounding the creation of these two translations. The study contributes to a
nuanced understanding of translation styles by incorporating computational
methodologies, shedding light on the intricate interplay between language,
culture, and the socio-cultural context in which translations emerge.
The Special Issue concludes with an article titled, “Poet-Composer
Collaborations in Egyptian Song: A Social Network Analysis Approach to
Egypt’s Musical History” by Michael Frishkopf that fascinatingly underscores
music as a profoundly relational art form, operating on an extensive scale
where interactions among various stakeholders, including composers, poets,
arrangers, conductors, performers, and producers, shape a complex network
of relationships. Recognizing the multifaceted nature of music history, which
evolves through these intricate connections over time, the focus is on song
production, particularly the collaborations between poets and composers.
While traditional music histories often concentrate on a limited number
of linear narratives, neglecting the broader network, this article contends
that a comprehensive understanding of musical history demands a big-data
empirical approach. In the context of Arab music, the article critiques the
tendency to spotlight a few prominent stars, repeating their stories without
fresh empirical research. Emphasizing that many influential musical figures
may not be widely recognized celebrities, the article argues that the intricate,
non-linear network of musical history cannot be adequately represented
through select linear narratives. It advocates for a big-data empirical approach
with a focus on a large network of collaborative relationships, leveraging
Social Network Analysis (SNA) tools. The proposed methodology centers
on applying SNA to a substantial dataset of poet-composer collaborations,
unveiling the social structure embedded in the history of song. The
interpretation of this structure is then contextualized within broader sociocultural and historical factors. Demonstrating the step-by-step application
of this methodology using a comprehensive database of Egyptian songs, the
article not only contributes insights into Egypt’s musical history but also
proposes a model that can be adapted to other domains. In essence, the
article argues that quantitative, algorithmic methods such as Social Network
Analysis, and qualitative interpretive methods intrinsic to humanistic

research, are not mutually exclusive or contradictory. Instead, they
harmoniously blend, each complementing and guiding the other in the
pursuit of a richer understanding of musical history.
This Special Issue on the potential and limits of Arabic Digital Humanities
reflects the work of several scholars in undertaking the collection, digitization,
annotation, clustering and analysis of an extensive collection of modern
Arabic cultural data. In order to derive culturally-relevant insights from this
corpus, the issue’s articles applies various methods and techniques (natural
language processing, network analysis, visualization, and data mining) tailored
to the analysis of Arabic cultural texts in a manner that would make them
useful for humanities research and for technical training of Machine Learning
tools. The project pursues a historical understanding of how some major
themes that pertain to modern Arabic modern culture, such as the East-West
encounter, modernism, liberalism, and the discourse about gender, race and
identity, to name a few, have developed over the years, and how they play out
through the prism of computational tools.
