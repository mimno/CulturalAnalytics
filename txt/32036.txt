ABSTRACT
Academic defenses of the humanities often make two assumptions: first, that the overwhelming
public perception of the humanities is one of crisis, and second, that our understanding of what
the humanities mean is best traced through a lineage of famous reference points, from Matthew
Arnold to the Harvard Redbook. We challenge these assumptions by reconsidering the
humanities from the perspective of a corpus of over 147,000 relatively recent national and
campus newspaper articles. Building from the work of the WhatEvery1Says project (WE1S), we
employ computational methods to analyze how the humanities resonate in the daily language of
communities, campuses, and cities across the US. We compare humanities discourse to science
discourse, exploring the distinct ways that each type of discourse communicates research,
situates itself institutionally, and discusses its value. Doing so shifts our understanding of both
terms in the phrase “public humanities.” We turn from the sweeping and singular conception of
“the public” often invoked by calls for a more public humanities to the multiple overlapping
publics instantiated through the journalistic discourse we examine. And “the humanities”
becomes not only the concept named by articles explicitly “about” the humanities, but also the
accreted meaning of wide-ranging mentions of the term in building names, job titles, and
announcements. We argue that such seemingly inconsequential uses of the term index diffuse
yet vital connections between individuals, communities, and institutions including, but not
limited to, colleges and universities. Ultimately, we aim to show that a robust understanding of
how humanities discourse already interacts with and conceives of the publics it addresses should
play a crucial role in informing ongoing and future public humanities efforts.

Michael Bérubé and Jennifer Ruth begin their 2015 book The Humanities, Higher
Education, and Academic Freedom by identifying “an iron law of American
journalism”: “no one is permitted to write the word ‘humanities’ in a sentence that
does not also include the word ‘decline.’”1 This association in journalistic discourse
of the humanities with crisis is deeply familiar to many humanists. The popular
narrative of American higher education over the last fifty years, Bérubé and Ruth
emphasize, is that “students have abandoned the humanities in droves.”2 While they

A COMPUTATIONAL ANA LYSIS OF US NATIONAL AND CAMPUS NEWSPAPERS

go on to argue that the real crisis in the humanities is not declining undergraduate
enrollments but rather a crisis in “graduate education and professional employment”
within higher education, the point remains that the humanities are often portrayed in
the news in the language of crisis.3 This framing affects how humanists view their
own disciplines, too, and it has inspired many to pen both public and academic
defenses of the humanities. Such pieces seek to advocate for the value of the
humanities, but they also usually take the crisis framing for granted. As Edward L.
Ayers puts it, “the language of crisis [has become] engrained in the self-perception
of the humanities.”4
As we will demonstrate, although this way of talking about the humanities is perhaps
the most readily identifiable, it is not the most common. “Everyday” news articles
reporting on the day-to-day activities of humanities faculty, celebrating students in
humanities classes, and announcing humanities events are far more plentiful in US
news discourse. Humanities scholars have a tendency to miss or ignore these kinds
of articles when writing pieces about the crisis in the humanities or arguing for the
relevance of the humanities. When Helen Small writes in The Value of the
Humanities, for example, that “[t]he primary aim of the following pages is to
examine the most commonly proffered reasons why the study of the humanities has
distinctive purpose and value,” the phrase “most commonly proffered” refers mainly
to the frequent surfacing of specific arguments advocating for the value of the
humanities within the pages of “well worn” academic texts.5 Exchanging the
traditional lineage of august defenses of the humanities often cited by scholars for a
much larger corpus of relatively ordinary contemporary journalism, we focus instead
on discussions of the humanities that emerge from a more expansive sense of the
“common” – as in, quotidian and widely-circulating news articles.6 How might an
emphasis on often unremarkable journalism not only alter our justifications for the
humanities, but also expand our very understanding of what the humanities are?
This article answers this question by examining newspaper articles containing the
word “humanities” (as well as other select keywords for comparison purposes). This
data is a subset of the data collected by the WhatEvery1Says: The Humanities in
Public Discourse (WE1S) project, which was funded by the Andrew W. Mellon
Foundation.7 Our corpus includes 147,204 documents from 624 unique mainstream
and student newspapers from across the United States published during the years
2

J OURNAL OF CU LTURAL A NALYTICS

1998-2018.8 We see these sources as offering an important, though not exclusive,
window on contemporary public discourse related to the humanities.9 As WE1S
recognizes, other keywords, like the names of individual disciplines, figures, or
texts, can also be markers of humanities discourse. But because “there is no
predefined, bounded set of media documents for studying public discussion of the
humanities,” it makes sense as an initial aim to study “a strategically chosen subset
of materials mentioning the literal word ‘humanities.’”10 Indeed, as we will show,
this method captures both “specialized academic discourse” around particular
humanistic disciplines, concepts and ideas as well as “wider, fuzzier public
discussion” of the humanities as part of everyday life and general culture.11 To get a
handle on this discourse, we utilize methods in exploratory data analysis including
simple counting, hypothesis testing, supervised and unsupervised forms of
modeling, and comparisons of word frequency data. The claims we make rely on
generalizations drawn from this analysis, but they also rely on close readings of
many individual articles that our computational analysis brought to our attention as
significant. Our methods are intended to investigate the diversity of ways of talking
about the humanities that exist in public discourse.12
We are thus concerned in this article, broadly speaking, with what is often called the
“public humanities.”13 However, our approach destabilizes both terms in this
phrase.14 We begin from the premise that any discussion of the humanities in public
must take into account the many overlapping publics that interact with the
humanities and with ideas about the humanities on an ongoing, daily basis. The
construction of our corpus turns from the sweeping and singular conception of “the
public” often invoked by calls for a more public humanities to the multiple, specific
publics addressed by the sources we examine.15 These publics include those
constituted by mainstream US newspaper discourse and by student newspapers
located on college and university campuses across the United States.
Additionally, the term “humanities” in our analysis turns protean. Humanities
scholars and professionals often use the term to refer to particular administrative
formations or academic disciplines (including English, history, philosophy, etc.),
and thus the humanities are often viewed, especially in the United States, as distinct
from the arts. However, in the news articles we examine, the humanities are
associated with a wide range of things including interpretive and scholarly activities,
3

A COMPUTATIONAL ANA LYSIS OF US NATIONAL AND CAMPUS NEWSPAPERS

institutional and administrative formations, pedagogical practices, artistic or creative
endeavors, and, as we discuss in the article’s final section, traces of public life, or
the implicit and often inchoate connections between individuals, communities, and
institutions. We are interested not in adhering to or arguing for any one definition of
the humanities, but rather in showing how the term operates in contemporary
newspaper discourse. Our methods allow us to examine the words, ideas and
practices with which the term “humanities” is commonly associated, associations we
might miss if we were searching for a particular definition of the term or seeking to
redefine it. For us, then, the phrase public humanities means an attempt to understand
how the term “humanities” resonates in the daily language of communities,
campuses, and cities across the US, albeit perhaps not in ways that scholars in the
humanities always recognize.16
In what follows, after describing our data in more detail, we explore two different
groupings of public discourse related to the humanities. We call the first “public
discourse about the humanities.” It centers on articles that take specific humanistic
disciplines or the concept of the humanities more generally as their main topic. We
pay particular attention to how such humanities discourse constitutes its own publics,
either through explicit invocations of the humanities as a public good or through the
embedding of public perceptions within an article’s structure. We find that while the
crisis in the humanities is part of the explicit framing of articles detailing
justifications for particular majors or bemoaning unwelcome administrative
decisions, this framing fades substantially in articles about humanities events,
classes, and accessible resources. To bring public discourse about the humanities
into sharper relief, we compare articles about the humanities to articles about
science.17 While discussions of the humanities and discussions of science share some
common features, we find that articles about the humanities communicate research
differently, invoke audiences associated with different institutions, and discuss
values in more abstract ways than articles about science.
We call the second grouping of public discourse related to the humanities
“humanities public discourse.” The removal of the word “about” in our phrasing is
important; the articles that constitute this category contain the word “humanities,”
but they aren’t about the humanities per se.18 Instead, these articles include incidental
mentions of this term in, for example, the name of a building, the title of a
4

J OURNAL OF CU LTURAL A NALYTICS

professorship, or the listing of an event. These kinds of articles outnumber articles
about the humanities in our corpus by a factor of 11. Despite their relative
prevalence, however, articles like this are often excluded from discussions of the
humanities, for the obvious reason that they are not “about” the humanities. Yet, as
we will see, such articles have a lot to tell us about how the concept of the humanities
operates and is valued today. They provide a view of how the humanities – as an
administrative formation, as a disciplinary tradition, as a set of interpretive and
creative activities, as a group of pedagogical practices, and more – are embedded in
everyday life, even when this embedding isn’t explicitly conceptualized as such.

Humanities Publics: Our Data
Table 1 displays breakdowns of the approximately 147,200 documents in our corpus
by publication date and source distribution. As we can see there, most of the articles
in our corpus were published between 2005 and 2018, and the distribution of articles
among our sources is uneven. The top 20 sources overall account for nearly 40% of
the total number of documents in the corpus, while the bottom 300 sources account
for only 5% of the total number.

Another way of understanding our data is to categorize it by source type. As we see
in Table 2, our corpus includes articles from the 15 top-circulating newspapers in
5

A COMPUTATIONAL ANA LYSIS OF US NATIONAL AND CAMPUS NEWSPAPERS

the United States as of 2019 and from 609 student newspapers from colleges and
universities located mainly in the United States.19 We have significantly more data
from student newspapers: just over 2/3 of the articles in our corpus are from this
source type, while about 1/3 are from top-circulating newspapers. Viewing our
corpus in this way highlights the two overlapping audience groups, or the two
publics, the articles we have collected address and therefore constitute. Discussions
of the public humanities often turn on distinctions between “academia” and “the
public,” which are usually presented either implicitly or explicitly as mutually
exclusive realms. As we mentioned above, however, the campus communities
addressed by student newspapers are other kinds of publics; they are not somehow
“not public” because they are composed of people who are enrolled in or who work
for colleges or universities. Furthermore, faculty and administrators often write or
contribute to articles that appear in mainstream newspapers.20 While these
communities are distinct, the boundaries between them are more porous than
discussions about the public humanities commonly assume. Table 2 also displays
another way of dividing our data. We can separate it into 3 keyword categories:
articles containing the words “humanities” or “liberal arts” (our humanities keyword
data), articles containing the words “science” or “sciences” (our science keyword
data), and articles that do not contain the word “humanities” (our comparison
keyword data).21 These keyword categories cut across both source types described
above.

However, as we mentioned in the introduction, the inclusion of a specific keyword
does not guarantee that an article is about the concept that keyword appears to name;
an article may include the word “humanities” but not actually be about the
humanities, a point we describe in more detail in the article’s final section. To zero
in on public discourse specifically about the humanities or about science, we built
classifiers designed to predict if a newspaper article is about the humanities or about
science. For our purposes, an article “about” the humanities or science was one in
which the main topic or central focus of the article was either a specific humanistic
or scientific discipline or the concept of “the humanities” or “science” itself.22 Our
classifiers were able to detect differences between articles about the humanities and
articles not about the humanities more easily than they were able to detect
differences between articles about science and articles not about science, although
they differentiated both categories with relatively high degrees of accuracy (Table
3). As we can see in Table 4, our classifier predicted that our corpus includes over
four times as many articles about science than articles about the humanities. Articles
about the humanities constitute a small percentage not only of our corpus overall but
also, perhaps more surprisingly, of our humanities keyword data. Of the over 34,700
articles in our corpus that include humanities keywords, our humanities classifier
predicted that only about 7% of these articles are about the humanities. This is also
true of our science keyword data: about 10% of documents that contain science
keywords were classified as being about science.

While the articles we have collected address two overlapping publics – readers of
campus newspapers and readers of top-circulating newspapers – our data also reveal
fault lines between these publics. Table 5 shows that the majority of articles
classified as being about the humanities are from student newspapers (91%), while
only a small portion of articles classified as being about the humanities are from top
newspapers (9%). Likewise, the majority of articles classified as being about science
are also from student newspapers (79%), although a slightly larger portion of articles
about science (as compared to those about the humanities) are from top newspapers
(21%). These numbers suggest that student newspapers are more likely to publish
articles about either science or the humanities than top newspapers; indeed, we might
expect student newspapers to publish more articles about academic subjects of any
kind than top-circulating newspapers. But when we compare the numbers of articles
about the humanities and about science published in each type of source to one
another, we see that articles about the humanities are disproportionately underrepresented in top newspapers and over-represented in student newspapers.23 When
top newspapers do publish articles about either the humanities or science, these
articles are even more likely than we might expect to be about science than about
the humanities. And conversely, while student newspapers still publish more total
pieces about science than they do about the humanities, they also tend to publish
more pieces about the humanities than expected.

Table 5: Number of documents classified as being about the humanities and as about science by source type.

Our data also reflect differences between campus communities. As Table 6 shows,
the majority of articles classified as being about the humanities from student
newspapers are from the newspapers of private institutions.24 Glancing at a list of
the ten student newspapers that contribute the most articles to the humanities
category (Table 7) reveals that these articles frequently appear not only in the
newspapers of private institutions, but in the newspapers of some of the nation’s
wealthiest and most elite private institutions: Stanford, Dartmouth, Harvard,
Princeton, and Cornell all top the list.25 The situation is reversed when we examine
articles that have been classified as being about science. The majority of these
articles are from newspapers located at public institutions (Table 6), and the ten
student newspapers that contribute the most articles to the science category include
newspapers from many large public research universities (Table 8). This difference
suggests a correlation between the institutional support and relative prestige of
humanities disciplines at elite private institutions and the appearance of articles
about the humanities in the student newspapers of those institutions. As Ayers
emphasizes, “the more exclusive and expensive the college or university, by and
large, the more established the relative position of the humanities.”26 Not all publics
are equally accessible – or equally public. Our data reflect the extent to which even
public discourse about the humanities is privatized, or at least centralized within the
most exclusive campus communities in the United States. Like the humanities
themselves, discussion of the humanities is, as Christopher Newfield writes, “a
luxury good found mostly at wealthy private universities.”27

Public Discourse About the Humanities
To examine the themes and keywords that surface in articles about the humanities,
and to bring out the salient features of such discourse in comparison with discourse
about science, we combined the documents our model predicted were about the
humanities with those it predicted were about science to produce a collection of
13,139 total documents. We have examined this collection in two ways. We
compared articles about the humanities to articles about science by running a
Wilcoxon rank sum test to discover the most distinctive words in each category. 28
We also produced a 100-topic model of this data.29 To analyze this topic model, we
first examined the top 100 articles associated with each topic and identified 12 topics
as those with the highest concentrations of top articles that our classifier categorized
as being about the humanities, 69 topics as those with the highest concentrations of
top articles about science, and 19 topics as those that fall in the middle.30 We then
created a label for each topic based on an assessment of each topic’s top keywords
and on reading its top articles.
This reading process suggested to us that throughout the 100 topics of our model run
three distinct though interrelated modes of public discourse, or ways of talking about
the humanities or science. We designate these modes here as the communicated, the
infrastructural, and the debated. Articles that contribute to the “communicated
mode” are often news items that convey the substance and content of humanities
and/or science projects, practices, research, and results. Articles associated with the
“infrastructural mode” tend to be informational and describe the systems, built
environments, bureaucracies, people, materials, and resources necessary for the dayto-day operations of a variety of institutions, including but not limited to institutions
of higher education. And articles in the “debated mode” detail controversial issues
and often take the form of opinion pieces, editorials, or reports on specific debates.
Such mode designations represent a human interpretation of machine learning; they
provide another dimension through which to view a topic model by registering our
understanding of how language resonates when the various components of a model
– keywords, articles, and topics – come together. The modes we identify act as an
interpretive framework for understanding our topic model rather than as exclusive
categories, as modes crisscross and overlap. Articles communicating research or
12

J OURNAL OF CU LTURAL A NALYTICS

debating an issue will sometimes also presuppose particular institutions and
infrastructures, for example, and single topics can easily contain articles that
contribute to more than one mode. Even so, in the discussion that follows, we include
tables representing the topics that we find to be most meaningfully associated with
different modes in order to identify broad trends in public discourse about the
humanities and the sciences.31
As we discuss in greater detail below, we find that articles about science that
contribute to the communicated mode report directly on the results of scientific
research, whereas articles about the humanities that contribute to this mode mediate
humanistic knowledge through descriptions of events and classes that foreground an
audience of attendees or students in addition to the implied audience of newspaper
readers. Articles about science contributing to the infrastructural mode reference
institutions ranging from the workplace to governmental agencies, whereas articles
about the humanities in this mode center institutions of higher education. And
articles about science associated with the debated mode mobilize scientific
knowledge in relation to specific issues in the public sector, suggesting concrete
actions, whereas articles about the humanities associated with this mode are more
abstract, often discussing the importance of the humanities in general without
offering an account of how humanistic knowledge could be applied to issues of
public concern.
The articles about science in our topic model that contribute to the communicated
mode convey scientific research results to their audience through a relatively
straightforward act of reporting. Language in topics associated with such articles is
concrete and specific (Table 9). The headlines of sample articles in each of these
topics foreground scientific findings: “BU researchers unveil underground world
where fungi fight climate change” (topic 80); “Study finds link between proteins,
electroconversion therapy response” (topic 81); and “UMass researchers studying
migratory patterns of bluefin tunas and other fish” (topic 84).32 In general, headlines
of articles associated with the communicated science mode adhere to a remarkably
formulaic pattern, with similar phrasing occurring in articles associated with topics
related to astronomy, cancer, viral infections, neuroscience, zoology and botany,
human ancestry and genetics, polar ice caps, cell biology, archaeology and
paleontology, quantum physics, planetary geology, health, and robotics, among
13

A COMPUTATIONAL ANA LYSIS OF US NATIONAL AND CAMPUS NEWSPAPERS

others.33 The language is that of discovery and investigation, and many pieces use
headline templates such as “Researchers find…” or “Studies show…” to
communicate results published in scientific papers. Such language reaches a pitch in
topic 32, which we labeled as “Research Findings and Publications,” consisting of
words such as “study,” “researchers,” “results,” “findings,” and “data.”34 We might
characterize the discursive pattern common to the communicated sciences as a single
act of communication: information follows a direct route from the reporter to the
primary audience of a reading public.35

Table 9: Sample Topics contributing to the “Communicated Science” mode.

This mode of research communication is almost entirely absent from articles that
our classifier tagged as being about the humanities. In comparison to the examples
cited above, consider the topics shown in Table 10 that we have designated as
contributing meaningfully to the communicated humanities mode. Headlines of
sample articles associated with these topics show us a humanities in medias res,
detailing events, projects, course programming, and accessibility efforts: “CLAS to
offer new major in Arabic and Islamic Civilizations” (67); “Uruguayan poet’s
campus visit includes reading” (18); “Panel Discussion at Dickinson College
14

J OURNAL OF CU LTURAL A NALYTICS

Addresses Feminism Within Sororities” (61); and “UCLA professors digitize
collections to allow greater access” (46).36 Most importantly, these articles operate
through a double layer of communication. Science articles, as we saw above, relay
research results directly to the reader. Humanities articles also present humanistic
knowledge, but, in contrast to science articles, this knowledge is often described in
the process of being conveyed to an audience. Such articles include discussion of the
objects and outcomes of humanities research, but only in the context of an act of
communication such as a class or a talk, which is then communicated again to the
reader. Instead of simply conveying the results of literary analysis, for example, an
article might convey such analysis as part of the context of a poetry reading.37 Instead
of focusing exclusively on a faculty member’s research, an article might include a
description of such research as part of a speaker’s biography that introduces a lecture
or panel discussion.38 Furthermore, many articles participating in this mode
explicitly thematize communication itself, particularly in relation to language
learning or translation. The study of language and culture, for example, is described
not only as providing students with “distinct communication skills” but also with
encouraging “a deeper understanding of what it means to communicate.”39

Table 10: Topics contributing to the “Communicated Humanities” mode.

As a function of their doubled communication, articles about the humanities often
foreground an embedded audience, particularly students, in addition to the implied
audience of newspaper readership. Newspaper readers see “many students
gathered...to listen” to a poetry reading, for example, and their own act of “listening”
occurs in concert with students’ reactions, as they watch them “interacting with
living poetry.”40 Similarly, academic fields come to life only through student
participation. We learn key concepts in disability studies, for example, through the
lens of students engaging with assigned texts in the classroom; likewise, discussion
of an American Indian Studies minor, which seeks “to expose” students “to the
experiences and history of American Indian folks,” also exposes the reader to this
field, in turn.41 Readers of these articles take their place among layers of other
readers – the “faculty and students...studying century-old documents such as...Emily
Dickinson’s poetry and Thomas Jefferson’s journals” in a college library, the
students who “go to [their] iPhone...as [they’re] walking back to [their] dorm room”
and “start reading the letters of Ben Franklin,” and “a new generation of readers” in
high school who are just beginning “to discover what literature can bring to their
lives.”42 Such publics are thus not just invoked or thematized; rather, they are
integral to the article’s structure. The reader accesses the humanities in these articles
through the mediation of extant audiences.
These articles are not only populated by publics already participating in the
humanities; they also invite further, future publics to join them. Pieces on
digitization efforts and the digital humanities often emphasize this invitation.
Common refrains highlight the “benefits” of “allowing access to materials that
otherwise wouldn’t be made public” and the “ability to share our resources
worldwide” through digitization.43 At stake is a “radical democratization of
knowledge” that resonates differently than articles about science associated with the
communicated mode.44 Though outward facing, the relaying of scientific research
tends to preserve a greater distance between the expert and the lay public. Such

16

J OURNAL OF CU LTURAL A NALYTICS

distance is somewhat collapsed in articles about the humanities when digital tools,
for example, are described as “giving more power to the reader to make the
decisions” by allowing literary artifacts to become “like a do-it-yourself kit.”45 The
implication is that “anybody,” like the student of digital humanities, could learn to
“tell meaningful stories with data,” adding their own acts of communication to those
of scholars.46
These articles make clear that one of the foremost acts of humanities communication
is college teaching. This association of the humanities with teaching also appears in
our second category of public discourse about the humanities, articles about the
humanities associated with the infrastructural mode. The topics that we have
identified as including many articles associated with this mode make the
bureaucracy of higher education visible, as evidenced by the pedagogical,
institutional, and procedural language listed in Table 11. What these examples make
clear is that, in contrast to articles about science that participate in this mode, which
we will detail shortly, articles about the humanities are associated almost exclusively
with the language of college administration, and they are well-peopled with
educational and administrative actors. Keywords such as “students,” “faculty,”
“committee,” “professors,” and “dean” all appear in these topics, along with
“courses,” “curriculum,” “departments,” “major,” “minor,” “teaching,” “semester,”
“learning,” and “classroom,” which describe the building blocks of humanities
infrastructure.47 Articles that contribute to this mode are not just “related” to
institutions of higher education; rather, they are evidence of day-to-day functioning
of these institutions, including announcements of new majors and minors, reports on
meetings, and articles about new faculty members or administrators who have
recently been hired.

Table 11: Topics contributing to the “Infrastructural Humanities” mode.

This language evidences the extent to which, as many scholars have argued, the
concept of “the humanities” itself is primarily administrative. As Ayers writes, “the
idea of the humanities developed simultaneously with the machinery of the
humanities.”48 This entanglement with the language of university administration,
however, belies a complex tension: in the articles that contribute to this discourse,
the humanities are depicted as simultaneously embedded within the bureaucratic
processes of academia – making decisions, holding meetings, and allocating
resources – and as alienated from those structures, on unstable footing amidst larger
infrastructural changes in higher education. Discussions of core courses, for
example, provide evidence of, as Michael Meranze has emphasized, “the
identification of the humanities with teaching and general education,” yet these
articles also demonstrate a tense push-and-pull relationship between the humanities
and curricular requirements.49 At stake is the extent to which the humanities factor
into, as one article puts it, “what a…graduate should look like.”50 In contrast to the
positivity and enthusiasm that characterize articles associated with the
communicated mode, a sense of crisis often pervades articles associated with the
infrastructural mode. In relation to enrollment patterns, for example, some directly
18

J OURNAL OF CU LTURAL A NALYTICS

name “the worsening economy” since 2008, and others address the impact of faculty
labor conditions and university hiring policies on undergraduate teaching and course
offerings.51 Articles detail sacrificed second language requirements and newly
prioritized corporate values of success pushed by what one faculty member
diagnoses as the agenda of “businessmen not educators.”52 Another faculty
member’s assessment of her colleagues’ reactions to restructuring sums it up well:
“panic in the humanities.”53
Articles that our classifier categorized as being about the sciences reveal a different
infrastructural topography. While both humanities and science articles demonstrate
attention to teaching and educational institutions, the apparatuses of research align
much more closely with articles about science, as seen in the topics listed in Table
12. Article headlines associated with the topic we labeled “Research Methods,
Infrastructure, and Administration” (26), for example, document the establishment
of research centers and the launching of interdisciplinary initiatives. Articles
associated with other topics listed in this table celebrate “the advantages of increased
speed and power to researchers” provided by advanced computational equipment
(94), showcase a vivid sense of the collaboration and teamwork necessary for
scientific research (65), and emphasize that “research is for students, too” (45).54

Table 12: Research-focused sample topics contributing to the “Infrastructural Science” mode.

The differences we see between articles participating in the infrastructural
humanities mode and those participating in the infrastructural science mode are also
suggested by the results of our Wilcoxon rank sum test. The words that are most
distinctive of articles about the humanities are associated with education, and
specifically with education as it is situated within institutions of higher education
(Table 13). Words like “students,” “courses,” “education,” “college,” “major,”
“department,” “academic,” “university,” and “faculty” occur more frequently in
articles about the humanities than they do in articles about science.55 In contrast, the
list of words most distinctive of articles about the sciences includes “researchers,”
“data,” and “lab” (Table 14).

humanities. “Frequency” refers to the term’s relative frequency per 500 terms in articles about science;
“Percentage Increase” refers to the percentage increase in use of that term in articles about science as compared to

least 1 test set. All comparisons listed have p-values below .002.

The different language that characterizes articles about the humanities and articles
about science also implies different publics. Whereas the infrastructural language of
the humanities aligns more closely with institutions of higher education, within
articles about science associated with the infrastructural mode, the university
registers in public discourse as one star among a constellation of many overlapping
institutions (Table 15). Alongside the university setting of the topic we labeled
“Campus Construction” (69), articles contributing to this mode mention many
additional institutions and infrastructures that exceed the framework of higher
education, such as the primary and secondary schools central to topic 76, labeled
“K-12 STEM,” and the broader healthcare systems indexed by topic 64, labeled
“Healthcare Research and Administration.” Top articles associated with the topic we
labeled “Industry and Investment” (9) – many of which come from top-circulating,
rather than student, newspapers – describe issues like venture capital, detail “the
deployment of university research into the market,” and discuss the process of
“securing commercial development deals for scientific discoveries.”56 Topic 56,
labeled “Risk, Safety, and Standards,” gathers together articles that detail the
relationships between scientific practice and accreditation bodies, legal systems, and
governmental review processes at both state and federal levels.57 And articles
associated with topic 8, which we labeled “Scientific Publishing and Research
Integrity,” imply the dual publics of both the scientific community and the layperson.

At stake are the professional standards of what it means to “do good science,” as
well as how to avoid an outcome in which “the general public loses trust in us.”58

Table 15: Further sample topics contributing to the “Infrastructural Sciences” mode.

Articles about the humanities contributing to our third category of discourse, the
debated mode, solidify the connection between the humanities and higher education.
This mode is the closest relative of the scholarly defenses of the humanities so
common in academia; articles broadly associated with this category often include
opinion pieces, letters to the editor, and reports on controversial issues that focus
23

A COMPUTATIONAL ANA LYSIS OF US NATIONAL AND CAMPUS NEWSPAPERS

explicitly on why and how the humanities should be taught in college. Table 16
identifies the topics that we find to be most meaningfully associated with the debated
humanities mode. In articles contributing to these topics, the crisis in the humanities
is explicitly and consistently named.59 Many pieces begin with a recognition of a
post-2008 economic landscape; authors write “as one concerned with the perceived
decline of the humanities” and situate themselves “at a time when support for the
humanities continues to dwindle.”60 “The cost to receive an education in the United
States has risen dramatically since our parents went to college,” one student writes,
leading the current generation to evaluate rigorously whether a humanities education
is “worth it.”61

Table 16: Topics contributing to the “Debated Humanities” mode.

Debates about the humanities in these articles quickly escalate into debates about the
meaning of a college education at large. As Meranze has argued, the humanities have
become “symbolically central to debates about the university’s place in
contemporary society” even as such debates often serve to render humanities
disciplines “structurally subordinate” to professional schools in particular.62 In these
articles, the humanities often emerge as a kind of collegiate canary – the health of
the humanities can be an indicator for the health of higher education more broadly,
and to imagine an exemplary humanities education is also to imagine an ideal college
experience. Student writers are particularly cogent in diagnosing “a gradual shift in
24

J OURNAL OF CU LTURAL A NALYTICS

the view of the purpose of higher education;” as one student writes, “focus is moving
away from the pursuit of knowledge and acquiring a greater understanding of our
place in the world, in favor of specific career training.”63 While recognizing past and
ongoing sea changes, articles we associate with this mode also urge readers to
rethink the future of education systems. In the face of objections that “the humanities
are interesting but impractical,” one student argues, “the solution must not be to shun
the humanities altogether, but to reform our expectations about what an education
is.”64 Debates about the humanities in core curricula prompt assertions that “we must
re-conceptualize the value systems that underlie liberal education” and spark
questions about “the primary obligation of the university in America.”65
Interestingly, however, some students are quick to dismantle such rhetoric,
criticizing the impulse to “[conflate] the humanities with education in general” and
insightfully differentiating that “the decline in humanities majors does not mean a
decline in the humanities.”66
Articles about the humanities that contribute to the debated mode often justify the
humanities by pivoting from the immediate public of college students to larger, more
general arguments about the public good. Many of these articles claim that studying
the humanities is a pursuit that, by making people “historically and politically
aware,” “prepares students to become citizens of the world” and forms a crucial part
of a “healthy civic life.”67 By “developing social consciousness and our ideas of
justice” and shaping voters and jurists “able to consider where other people are
coming from,” the humanities emerge in these articles as central to citizenship.68 As
one article puts it, “democracy is...dependent on a society that is informed by the
humanities.”69
Articles about science contributing to the debated mode also often invoke public
engagement, but they do so in a way that mobilizes specific research content in
relation to specific issues, referring to laws, bills, hearings, policies, and presidential
agendas to provide context for their claims. Table 17 provides examples of topics
that we associate with this mode. In a typical progression, an article on cloning (topic
5) begins with a political frame (“President Bush is working with Congress on
legislation that would outlaw human cloning in the United States”), then moves to
an ethical claim (“As enlightened human beings, we have an ethical responsibility
not to clone people”), then recounts the scientific process behind the debate in depth
25

A COMPUTATIONAL ANA LYSIS OF US NATIONAL AND CAMPUS NEWSPAPERS

(“A clone is created when a cell’s genetic material is implanted into an egg cell that
has had its genetic material removed”).70 Similar patterns and argumentative
strategies occur in articles contributing to topics about stem cells (55), drug use (19),
and genetically modified organisms (52).71 The topic we labeled “Science and
Politics” (14) gathers together articles characterized by this language, as we can see
from top keywords such as “science,” “president,” “political,” “policy,” and
“government.” Articles associated with these topics advocate for a wide variety of
relationships between science and the democratic process, ranging from the
perspective that “federal and state legislators have no business tying scientists’
hands” to arguing for “more scientists and engineers to leave their labs and
universities and run for public office, including U.S. Congress.” 72 Authors also
question the role of science in public education. Articles on evolution and intelligent
design associated with topic 7, for example, ask the reader to consider what “a
teacher of science” “should be responsible for” and what the “purpose” of “a science
classroom” is.73

Table 17: Sample Topics contributing to the “Debated Science” mode.

The specificity of articles about science participating in this mode differs markedly
from the relative abstraction of articles about the humanities that contribute to the
debated mode. The greatest degree of specificity in articles about the humanities
associated with this mode emerges in those connected to topic 25 (Table 16), which
we labeled “History and Intellectual Traditions,” about the status of the Western
canon in debates around core curricula. Here, authors assess “books that have
contributed to the great Western conversation” and grapple with the concrete
composition of “an ideal humanistic education” that will create “global-minded and
ethical citizens.”74 Other articles about the humanities associated with this mode
gesture briefly towards opportunities for the application of humanistic knowledge,
writing that “the demand for incorporating ethics, rhetoric, history or epistemology
into topics like artificial intelligence, climate change, technological disruption or
machine learning has increased dramatically,” and that the key is “to connect
humanistic insight to other disciplines, from atmospheric sciences to informatics.” 75
Yet there is little concrete description of how such processes of application to the
public sphere would actually take place.76 Encounters with specific texts – like
“expos[ure] to the anguish of Othello” – are quickly abstracted into values like
“learning leadership” and “commit[ting] ourselves to the service of others” with
little clear sense of the steps in between.77
The word “humanities” itself thus often indexes a strange absence in these articles.
Unlike in articles about science in the debated mode, there is often a lack of clarity
about how specific conclusions drawn from humanistic research could be leveraged
in service to specific facets of the public good.78 These articles are about the
humanities in the sense that they directly name the humanities as a subject of debate,
reflection, concern, and interest, but they are also about the humanities in the sense
27

A COMPUTATIONAL ANA LYSIS OF US NATIONAL AND CAMPUS NEWSPAPERS

of skirting around a central focus. They often hold the humanities in their peripheral
vision, focusing on the skills, values, social benefits, and flexible career paths to
which the study of humanistic subjects might lead, but often substituting such
aboutness for a concrete account of what humanistic knowledge actually entails. If
a reader didn’t already have a conception of what the act of humanistic research is,
then it would be difficult to construct such a conception from reading these articles.79
Taken together, the discursive modes that we have explored here suggest an inverse
relationship in public discourse about the humanities between the representation of
specific humanistic practices and content and the justification of the humanities in
response to economic crisis. Articles about the humanities associated with the
communicated mode have a high degree of specificity: though we don’t see the same
straightforward presentation of research findings that characterize articles about
science associated with this mode, these articles still lay out concrete details of
humanities courses, research projects, publications, and events. The humanities
crisis is not a prominent frame in such articles. At the other end of the spectrum,
articles about the humanities associated with the debated mode often discuss this
crisis, but they also often discuss the humanities in a general way. While there is no
single way of discussing the humanities in newspapers today, what is often missing
from such discussions are articles that connect the concrete particulars of humanistic
knowledge and practices to larger values and outcomes.

Humanities Public Discourse
Our above analysis focuses on articles about the humanities, but as Table 4 indicates,
such articles constitute only a small portion of all the articles in our corpus, even
among those articles that contain humanities keywords. How does the concept of the
humanities appear in this larger portion of our corpus, and how might such
appearances shift our understanding of what it means to talk “about” the humanities
in newspapers today? To answer these questions, we turn to those articles that
contain humanities or science keywords but that our classifiers did not categorize as
being about the humanities or science. These articles comprise most of our data, and
they generally feature seemingly incidental mentions of the words “humanities,”
“liberal arts,” “science,” or “sciences.” As we might expect, articles that contain such

28

J OURNAL OF CU LTURAL A NALYTICS

incidental mentions of these words but that aren’t about the humanities or science
are more broadly like one another than articles that have been classified as being
about the humanities or science are to each other. When we compared articles that
contain humanities keywords but that aren’t about the humanities to articles that
contain science keywords but that aren’t about science using the Wilcoxon rank sum
test mentioned in the previous section, we found many fewer statistically distinctive
words for each category than we did when we ran this test comparing articles about
the humanities to articles about science.80 This makes sense, given that articles
belonging to these two categories are from the same kinds of sources and are not
held together by anything other than the presence of specific keywords.
There are some differences between these categories, however. For instance, as we
can see in Table 18, articles that contain humanities keywords but that haven’t been
classified as being about the humanities are still more likely to contain words
associated with education, specifically with higher education, than articles
containing science keywords but that haven’t been classified as being about science.
Indeed, many of the words that are most likely to appear in these articles – including
“professor,” “courses,” and “studies” – look similar to the most distinctive words in
articles about the humanities (Table 13).

Table 18: A list of the top 20 most distinctive words in articles that contain humanities keywords but that our
classifier did not categorize as being about the humanities compared to articles that contain science keywords but
that our classifier did not categorize as being about science. “Frequency” refers to the term’s relative frequency per
500 terms in articles containing humanities keywords; “Percentage Increase” refers to the percentage increase in
use of that term in articles containing humanities keywords as compared to articles containing science keywords;
and “Wilcoxon Statistic” is a measure of how distinctive that term is to articles containing humanities keywords
(the higher the value, the more distinctive the term is to this set of articles). We tested a random selection of 1500
documents from each category, only including words that appeared at least 5 times across all documents in at least
1 test set. All comparisons listed have p-values below .001.

But Table 18 also includes words that don’t appear in Table 13, such as “cultural,”
“books,” “director,” and “program.” These words point us toward a salient feature
of what we are calling humanities public discourse. When we used a Wilcoxon rank
sum test to compare these articles to public discourse about the humanities, or
articles our classifier categorized as being about the humanities, we found that
articles containing the word “humanities” but that our classifier did not categorize
as being about the humanities contain more frequent “event language” – words such
as “day,” “family,” “week,” “children,” “city,” “local,” and “free” (Table 19). These
words often occur in event announcements, particularly announcements about
municipal and regional arts events, museum exhibits, and readings at local
bookstores, indicating a broad range of inscribed humanities publics beyond the
institutions of higher education.

A COMPUTATIONAL ANA LYSIS OF US NATIONAL AND CAMPUS NEWSPAPERS

To add more depth to our understanding of humanities public discourse, we
examined a 150-topic model of 27,362 articles containing the word “humanities” but
that our classifier did not categorize as being about the humanities.81 As with the
topic model discussed in the previous section, we analyzed this model by creating a
label for each topic based on examining each topic’s top keywords and top articles.82
This model includes topics that focus on humanistic fields, experiences, and art
forms, such as those we labeled “Dance” (11), “Languages” (72), and “Poetry” (87),
as well as topics about additional fields or sectors like “Medicine” (124) or
“Business” (115). Topics about a range of social issues appear as well, including
those labeled “American Politics” (45), “Criminal Justice” (58), “Environment and
Climate Change” (99), “Gender Equity” (23), and “Race and Civil Rights” (6). As
the results of the Wilcoxon test described above suggest, we also found that many
topics include event language. Topic 77, for example, includes keywords like
“event,” “festival,” “day,” “week,” “annual,” “celebration,” and “community.” A
typical article associated with this topic, titled “Why thousands of school children
are on Fresno State’s campus,” describes a festival “created to help young people
gain knowledge and appreciation of literature through oral interpretation and
performance,” while another advertises a “Festival of International Books and Arts”
that “highlight[s] the importance of literacy in the Hispanic community.”83
Similarly, topic 48 includes the keywords “lecture,” “event,” “professor,”
“discussion,” “conference,” “audience,” “students,” and “questions;” articles
associated with this topic advertise events, conferences, symposia, and other kinds
of public discussions, with some, like the one titled “University and city host book
talk,” explicitly bridging the boundary between academia and broader publics.84
Twelve further topics in this model gather together community calendar and event
listings, articles that are often clustered into discrete topics by specific paper or
geographical region.85 Furthermore, topics we labeled “Music” (65) and
“Performing Arts” (98) consist mainly of advertisements and announcements for
performances, while topics labeled “Literary Events” (37), “Film” (42), “Fine Arts,”
(2) and “Museum and Gallery Listings” (10) announce readings, film festivals, and
art exhibitions.86 This robust strain of humanities public discourse is outward-facing
and participatory, continuing and intensifying trends that we observed in articles
about the humanities associated with the communicated mode. Humanities public
discourse centers on acts of communication, such as events, festivals, and talks, it

32

J OURNAL OF CU LTURAL A NALYTICS

invokes embedded publics of audience members, and it does not frame itself in terms
of crisis.
In contrast to public discourse about the humanities, then, humanities public
discourse showcases the expansive range of institutions associated with the
humanities.87 Many topics in this model still focus on the academic infrastructure
and student experiences central to higher education, including those we labeled
“Courses and Curricular Programs” (8), “Faculty Service and Committees” (32),
“College Majors and Jobs” (44), and “Student Research” (25). However, many other
kinds of institutions and community infrastructure also appear in these articles,
including in articles associated with topics labeled “Libraries” (119), “Museums”
(122), “Military” (7), “Summer Camp” (51), and “Primary and Secondary
Education” (20).88 Articles associated with topics we titled “Community
Volunteering” (126) and “Local Bureaucracy” (89) often reference regional
humanities centers, and in articles associated with a topic labeled “City
Government” (29), the word “humanities” appears in the biographies of candidates
for local elections. Other topics, like those we titled “Housing and Real Estate” (75)
and “Local Restaurants” (38), gather articles that reveal the humanities to be deeply
rooted in the built environment. A humanities building or school, for example, can
act as a community landmark mentioned in discussions of other neighborhood
features. And in articles contributing to topic 66, labeled “Local Sports,” the term
“humanities” occurs repeatedly in the name of a New York high school.
These contexts are mundane, but they map the connections between the humanities
and public life; the presence of the word “humanities” reveals how the humanities
are embedded in local infrastructure, indexing a much longer lineage of past values
and decisions. These instances mark the moments when an educational institution
focused on the humanities becomes something to cheer for at a basketball game, a
reference point that might influence the decision to buy a home, a factor in local
governance, or part of a daily commute. Some articles also make clear the role that
humanities institutions themselves play in shaping local environments by adding
historic buildings to the register, for example, or by commissioning public art
displays.89 This association of the humanities with a wide range of institutions
emphasizes the humanities as public-facing, active, and engaged with local
communities.
33

A COMPUTATIONAL ANA LYSIS OF US NATIONAL AND CAMPUS NEWSPAPERS

Other strains of humanities public discourse include public commemorations of
momentous life events like marriage and death. In articles contributing to a topic
composed of wedding announcements (117), the word “humanities” indexes the
educations and professions of couples and their families through the listing of
degrees or job titles. In articles contributing to several topics comprised of obituaries,
humanities organizations are often noted as a preferred recipient of donations made
in honor of the deceased.90 Obituaries thus both act as a public record of the impact
of the humanities on individuals’ lives and further galvanize the mourning publics
addressed by such death notices. Importantly, the obituaries of scholars and writers
(as seen in topic 112, for example) also act as key sites of direct communication of
humanities knowledge when they describe these figures’ publications and
influence.91 Given the relative absence of direct humanities research communication
elsewhere in our corpus, this observation suggests that the impact of humanistic
research is often conveyed in straightforward ways in the press when the person who
conducted that research has died. Yet in this context, such research communication
is also inseparable from the personal details that make up a life. In these obituaries,
the humanities index the ways that personal experiences across a lifetime (family
relationships, education, hobbies) and professional accomplishments across a career
(teaching, publications, and access to academic resources) intertwine with local,
regional, and national institutions of all kinds. Both the personal and the professional
are therefore pivotal components of the public resonance of the humanities.
While announcements and obituaries do not constitute the majority of articles
containing humanities keywords but that aren’t classified as being about the
humanities – most of the articles in this category, as in our corpus overall, are simply
news articles – they are important for understanding what we mean by humanities
public discourse.92 A History professor’s obituary and an announcement about a
reading at a local bookstore are not “about” the humanities in the same way an
editorial defending the value of the humanities is about the humanities. Yet it is also
not correct to claim that these articles are not about the humanities. Broadly
speaking, these articles register how the humanities are associated with the
experiences of many different publics, from museum-goers to children participating
in a summer camp to attendees of a wedding or a funeral. These kinds of “eventoriented” and “local” articles that document the “ordinary life and work happening
in, through, and all around the humanities,” are evidence of how, as Tarika Sankar
34

J OURNAL OF CU LTURAL A NALYTICS

writes, “the humanities become part of the background of everyday life.” 93 Those
advocating for the humanities to become more public-facing often miss this
background. When they argue, for example, that humanities scholars need to
emphasize “a regrounding of the humanities in the world around us,” they do not
usually consider how unremarkable yet common news genres like obituaries and
event announcements demonstrate the extent to which the humanities are already
embedded in this world.94
Considering such incidental mentions of the word “humanities” as indexing at least
some of the public work of the humanities challenges perceptions of the humanities
that view them as disconnected from the world beyond academia. As we’ve
discussed in this article, as opposed to the wide range of institutions referenced by
articles about science, articles about the humanities do often focus on institutions of
higher education and undergraduate audiences. These articles are underrepresented
in mainstream newspapers and overrepresented in student newspapers; what’s more,
they are more likely to appear in newspapers located at some of the nation’s
wealthiest and most elite private institutions. However, articles about the humanities
also tend to relay ideas and discoveries developed through humanities research and
teaching less directly than articles about science, operating through a double layer
of communication that focuses on descriptions of classes or events humanists have
organized or in which humanities scholarship has been discussed. Such articles
foreground how the humanities come to life through the mediation of extant
audiences both within and beyond university walls.
But such articles explicitly about the humanities are not very common in either
mainstream or student newspapers. Far more common are those articles discussed in
this last section, articles that, in announcing a reading at a local bookstore or relaying
the details of someone’s life or even reporting the score of a basketball game, trace
the contours of individuals’ and communities’ relationships with an expansive set of
activities, practices, and institutions associated with the humanities. Such articles
provide a view of the humanities that, while more inchoate and diffuse than many
understandings of the term, is also more oriented toward activities, events, and
everyday life. The challenges confronting higher education in the United States
today are substantial, to say the least, and advocates for the humanities, like those
for both the natural and social sciences, will need to continue to make the case for
35

A COMPUTATIONAL ANA LYSIS OF US NATIONAL AND CAMPUS NEWSPAPERS

their value in the years to come. Rather than resorting to talk of continual crisis, such
advocates may wish to focus in part on the more expansive understandings of the
humanities that we see in our corpus. Far from propagating a narrative of decline,
many newspaper articles today inspire hope, conveying a sense of the humanities as
engaged, energetic, and vital.

Ibid., 10. However, as Ben Schmidt argued in 2018, data gathered since 2014 show the number of students
majoring in humanities disciplines has rapidly dropped since 2007. See Schmidt, “The Humanities Are in Crisis,”
The Atlantic, August 23, 2018. https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/08/the-humanities-face-a-crisisofconfidence/567565/.
Edward L. Ayers, “Where the Humanities Live,” Daedalus 138. 1 (2009): 25. The scholarship on the “humanities
crisis” is voluminous, and it is marked especially by the proliferation of special issues and edited collections on the
value of the humanities that emerged in the wake of the 2008 recession. For example, see Michelle Ty, ed., “Higher
Education on Its Knees,” Qui Parle: Critical Humanities and Social Sciences 20.1 (2011); and Eleonora Belfiore
and Anna Rosser Upchurch, eds., Humanities in the Twenty-First Century: Beyond Utility and Markets (New York:
Palgrave Macmillan, 2013). Recent books have also focused on the crisis in employment in the academic
humanities. See Sidonie Smith, A Manifesto for the Humanities: Transforming Doctoral Education in Good Enough
Times (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 2015); and Katina L. Rogers, Putting the Humanities PhD to
Work: Thriving in and Beyond the Classroom (Durham: Duke University Press, 2020). Finally, in accordance with
Ayers, Paul Reitter and Chad Wellmon argue in their recent book Permanent Crisis that crisis is integral to the “selfunderstanding of the modern humanities,” as “crisis has played a crucial role in grounding the idea that the
humanities have a special mission.” See Reitter and Wellmon, Permanent Crisis: The Humanities in a Disenchanted
Age (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2021), 3.

A trope employed by many academic histories and defenses of the humanities is to center the 1945 “Harvard
Redbook,” a report written by Harvard faculty during WWII. This document outlined a vision of the humanities as
central to the postwar world, and it is often considered, as Geoffrey Galt Harpham writes, “the single most important
document in the history of ‘the humanities.’” See Harpham, The Humanities and the Dream of America (Chicago:
University of Chicago Press, 2011), 153. This version of the history of the humanities not only ties the fate of the
humanities to the American system of higher education overall; it also implicitly presents higher education as the
only arena in which the meaning and value of the humanities is negotiated.

WE1S collected these articles using the LexisNexis API, which requires the use of keyword searches to collect
data. The conclusions we draw from our data are dependent not only on the decisions WE1S researchers made in
how to collect this data, but also on the fact that the data LexisNexis owns is not a straightforward representation of
“journalistic discourse” from this period. As a private company, the decisions LexisNexis has made about what to
acquire and why are not transparent. It is therefore more accurate to say that our data reflect decades of corporate
decisions that have determined what journalistic discourse is preserved in digital form. For more on the issue of
representativeness in the WE1S corpus at large, see Giorgina Paiella, “Thoughts on Diversity in the Archive,”

Our timeframe is limited by the materials that we could collect in digitized, full-text form. Such materials are
available primarily after 1998, and, in bulk, from around 2005 on. These years mark a period of contraction for
journalism. Penelope Muse Abernathy has reported that from 2004-2019, more than one in five newspapers in the
United States closed and the number of journalists employed by papers was cut in half. These losses have hit local
and regional newspapers the hardest. See Abernathy, “The Loss of Local News: What It Means for Communities,”
The Expanding News Desert, accessed May 1, 2021, https://www.usnewsdeserts.com/reports/expanding-newsdesert/loss-of-local-news/. While we treat journalistic media as an important window on how the public perceives
and discusses the humanities, we recognize that newspapers are not the only venue for such discussion. Other parts
of the WE1S project, for example, address social media and other kinds of materials, such as foundation reports, that
are also part of this public discourse. For discussions of findings from this research, see WE1S key finding cards;
“Research Key Findings,” WhatEvery1Says, accessed May 2, 2021, https://we1s.ucsb.edu/research/we1sfindings/key-findings/. For a discussion of research on Reddit in particular, see Raymond Steding, “A Digital

Our analysis also complements other attempts to gather data about the public perception of the humanities, such as

13

Other scholars as well have sought to destabilize the phrase “public humanities.” Kristen Case, for example, asks
us to consider “the other public humanities,” which starts not with “empowering elite students and faculty members
to reach out to their communities,” but rather with dedicated pedagogy in the “classrooms of the public university.”
See Case, “The Other Public Humanities,” The Chronicle of Higher Education, January 13, 2014.
14

As Michael Warner argues, such publics “do not exist apart from the discourse that addresses them.” Warner,
Publics and Counterpublics (Durham: Duke University Press, 2002), 72.
15

Michael Levenson does something similar in his recent book The Humanities and Everyday Life, which seeks “to
locate humanistic study within the wide field of everyday life and to consider how academic practices intersect with
the aims and habits of those outside university walls.” Levenson focuses on the connections between the activities of
professionally credentialed humanities experts working at colleges and universities and “daily practices” such as
“the activities of book clubs, museum-goers, private collectors, domestic genealogists, historical re-enactors, editors

of Wikipedia.” See Levenson, The Humanities and Everyday Life (New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 2017),
1, 1-2.
17

A rhetorical opposition to science is at the foundation of the history of the institutionalization of the humanities in
the United States. As Reitter and Wellmon argue, during the early twentieth century, one rationale for the formation
of humanities departments depended explicitly on the perceived opposition of the humanities to scientific
instrumentalism. Advocates argued the humanities were necessary to provide “unity of knowledge, clarity of
purpose, moral value, and a regeneration of the uniquely human in the face of the centrifugal pressures of science
and technology.” See Permanent Crisis, 228. Comparisons to science thus have a long history in discussions of the
humanities.
Most of the articles included in this category contain the word “humanities,” but about 16% contain the related
phrase “liberal arts.” A full discussion of the relationship between these terms is beyond the scope of this article, but
significantly, there is little overlap between these keyword categories in our data. Only about 2% of articles in this
category contain both “humanities” and “liberal arts.”
18

19

The 15 top-circulating newspapers in the US as of 2019 included The New York Times, The Washington Post,
Chicago Tribune, The Dallas Morning News, The Boston Globe, The LA Times, Newsday, Star Tribune, The
Houston Chronicle, The Denver Post, The Seattle Times, Daily News, New York Post, USA Today, and Tampa Bay
Times. A list of all 624 sources from which we have collected data is included in this article’s supplementary data in
the “data/tables” folder (“sources_by_year.csv”). We say that our campus newspaper data are from sources located
“mainly in the United States” because our data include about 500 documents from newspapers in Canada, Europe,
and the UK.
As Jamal Russell notes in a discussion of the construction of race in the media, for example, “articles by or
quoting humanists…become sites where humanists directly influence public conversation” and, in turn, lend
“authority and credibility” to news sources. See Russell, “Public discourse as represented in the media treats
humanists as authorities on cultural discourses about race, racism, and ethics,” WhatEvery1Says, accessed May 2,
2021, https://we1s.ucsb.edu/wp-content/uploads/KF-3-1.pdf.

WE1S gathered the comparison data using keyword searches of 3 of the most common words in the English
language (based on a well-known analysis of the Oxford English Corpus) that LexisNexis indexes and thus makes
available for search: “person,” “say,” and “good.” We excluded the word “humanities” from our search in collecting
these documents. For more information about our comparison data, see “WE1S Datasets,” WhatEvery1Says,
accessed May 1, 2021, https://we1s.ucsb.edu/research/we1s-materials/datasets/.
22

We created training data for these classification experiments by manually identifying articles about the humanities
and about science, as well as articles not about the humanities and not about science, from our two source types. We
then used this data to test our classifiers on articles from our corpus that these classifiers had never seen.
Transformed versions of this training data are included in this article’s supplementary data; see the “classification”
module’s “README.md” file for more information. Of course, since there is no one way of defining what an
“article about the humanities” or an “article about science” is, these experiments train our classifier to replicate our
judgments regarding these categories. For a good explanation of concepts in machine text classification from the
perspective of cultural analytics, see Chapter 3, “Recognition: Literary Distinction and Blackness” in Richard Jean
So, Redlining Culture: A Data History of Racial Inequality and Postwar Fiction (New York: Columbia University
Press, 2021).
23

We used a chi-square test for independence to compare these values. Our results indicate that we can reject the
null hypothesis, meaning there is likely a relationship between the subject an article is about (science or the
humanities) and source type (top-circulating or student newspapers). Based on the proportion of articles classified as
being about the humanities out of the total number of articles classified as being about either the humanities or
science, we could expect roughly 21% of articles from both top newspapers and student newspapers to be classified
as being about the humanities if the distribution of articles about the humanities were uniform across source type.
Instead, only about 11% of articles from top newspapers have been classified as being about the humanities, while
about 24% of articles from student newspapers have been classified as being about the humanities. Meanwhile, if the
distribution of articles about science were uniform across source type, we would expect roughly 79% of articles

38

J OURNAL OF CU LTURAL A NALYTICS

from both top newspapers and student newspapers to be classified as being about science; instead, 89% of articles
from top newspapers and 76% of articles from student newspapers have been classified as being about science. The
chi-square statistic for this test is 215.47, with a p-value of 8.81e-49. See the “README.md” file in the
“data/tables” directory in this article’s supplementary data for a description of the contingency table used in this test.
24

WE1S collected metadata about each unique source in its datasets, allowing us to categorize student newspaper
sources by type of institution. See “Metadata Tags for WE1S Document Sources,” WhatEvery1Says, accessed May
1, 2021, https://we1s.ucsb.edu/research/metadata-tags/.
25

Because data collected from the LexisNexis API include so many duplicates, WE1S developed our own process
for detecting and automatically deleting duplicates and near-duplicates in our data. See this article’s repository’s
“README.md” file for more information about the de-duplication process. However, automatically de-duplicating
articles from The Stanford Daily in particular proved challenging because of how articles from this source are
formatted when downloaded from LexisNexis. This may be one reason why articles from The Stanford Daily so far
outnumber articles from other student newspaper sources.

We identified the 100-topic model as the best fit for our data by comparing it to models of the same data with 25,
50, 150, 200, and 250 topics. We used the top documents as displayed by Andrew Goldstone’s dfr-browser to
categorize topics (Goldstone calculates this metric differently than MALLET does). Topics with high concentrations
of top documents about the humanities are those in which at least 80 of the top 100 articles were categorized by our
classifier as being about the humanities. We used the same metric to find topics with high concentrations of top
documents about science (at least 80 of 100). Topics that fall in the middle are topics in which neither articles about
the humanities nor articles about science dominate the list of top documents in this way.

As Alan Liu has noted, US news media doesn’t just communicate about the sciences more concretely and more
directly; it also tends to emphasize “catchy” scientific objects “like distant exoplanets, dwarf suns, black holes,
spacecraft, or space telescopes.” “By contrast,” Liu notes, “the humanities seem to be object-poor,” often focusing
on just one object in particular: books. See Liu, “The public likes to take its science with objects, the bigger or
stranger the better,” WhatEvery1Says, accessed May 2, 2021, https://we1s.ucsb.edu/wp-content/uploads/KF-5-4.pdf.

We are building on the observations of Tarika Sankar and Alan Liu, who have emphasized that the media views
the humanities “as primarily all about the university.” Compared to descriptions of science, which they note are not
centered exclusively on “academic programs,” discussions of the humanities tend to isolate the humanities within
the academy. See Sankar and Liu, “The humanities appear to the public to be siloed in universities (unlike the
sciences),” WhatEvery1Says, accessed May 2, 2021, https://we1s.ucsb.edu/wp-content/uploads/KF-5-2.pdf.

We might assume that the prevalence of language about institutions, education, and research is because the
majority of the articles classified as being about the humanities come from student newspapers. Interestingly,
however, the general linguistic patterns we observe about these categories hold even if we only examine data from
top-circulating US newspapers. If we look only at articles from top newspapers, the words most distinctive to
articles about the humanities include “students,” “education,” “college,” and “courses,” while those most distinctive
to articles about science include “scientists,” “researchers,” “found,” “effects,” and “journal.” Once again, words
associated with education as it is situated within institutions of higher education are more likely to occur more
frequently within articles about the humanities. See the “hum-sci-wilcoxon-min5-260-topnewspapers.xlsx” file in
the “data/tables” directory in this article’s data repository to examine these results.

Several articles that contribute to topic 61, which we label “Diversity and Social Justice” and associate with the
communicated humanities mode, do detail the relationship between humanistic fields and concrete civic actions.
Interestingly, in examining other WE1S data, project members have found that media discussions of specific social
issues often fail to invoke the larger conceptual framework of the humanities. See, for example, sam goli,
“Contributions of the academic humanities to thought on gender and sexual identity have little impact on media
coverage of these issues,” WhatEvery1Says, accessed December 5, 2021, https://we1s.ucsb.edu/wpcontent/uploads/KF-3-5.pdf.
78

Similarly, Liu has observed how “humanities fields such as literary studies, history, or philosophy blur together in
media coverage as interchangeable parts in the university.” See Liu, “The sciences stand out for the public as
distinct fields (unlike the humanities, which blur together as just ‘academics’),” WhatEvery1Says, accessed May 2,
2021, https://we1s.ucsb.edu/wp-content/uploads/KF-5-7.pdf.

The test identified 82 words distinctive of articles containing humanities keywords but not classified as being
about the humanities and 16 words distinctive of articles containing science keywords but not classified as being
about science. When we compared articles classified as being about the humanities to articles classified as being
about science, the test identified 159 words as distinctive of articles about the humanities and 72 words as distinctive
of articles about science. See the “not-hum-not-sci-min5-1500-wilcoxon.xslx” and the “hum-sci-wilcoxon-500min5.xlsx” files in the “data/tables” folder in this article’s repo.

This association of the humanities with public events dovetails with observations Tarika Sankar has made about
how the concept of literature is discussed in mainstream US media. Sankar writes, “The media portrays [literature]
both as a hermetic academic activity and as a robust milieu of everyday social activities related to books and reading
– e.g., book talks, poetry readings, announcements of literary prizes, and obituaries of poets and writers.” See
Sankar, “Literature has a split personality in the media. It is tied to the academy, yet bridges to public life in
everyday book & reading events,” WhatEvery1Says, accessed May 2, 2021, https://we1s.ucsb.edu/wpcontent/uploads/KF-5-11.pdf.
As Harpham puts it, the humanities are an “institutional concept.” See Harpham, The Humanities and the Dream
of America, 80.
87

Christina Roberts notes the presence of terms such as “children,” “museums,” “nonprofits,” and “historical
societies” in relation to discussions of federal funding. Roberts, “The media covers U.S. government funding for the
humanities as a generalized mix of arts, humanities, and heritage funding,” WhatEvery1Says, accessed May 2, 2021,

Topics 21, 46, 61, 57, and 111 are strongly associated with obituaries.

Obituaries of this kind also surface in topics about specific fields, such as those we labeled “Philosophy” (106)
and “Western History” (149).
91

92

This claim is based on experiments we conducted with training classifiers to identify event announcements and
obituaries in our data. 1% of articles across our entire corpus were classified as announcements, while just under 2%
were classified as obituaries. 80% of the articles classified as event announcements and 82% of the articles classified
as obituaries came from top-circulating newspapers.
