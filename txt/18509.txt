ABSTRACT
Our project, which aims to reconstruct racial discourse in American literature, tracks three
critical aspects of the representation of race and ethnicity in a corpus of over 18,000 American
novels published between 1789 and 1920. First, we provide a historically sensitive account of
the ethnicities that most occupied the nation’s racial imaginary, registering how different ethnic
groups were perceived to be biologically, geographically, or socially linked. Second, we track
the descriptive terms most associated with particular ethnicities over time as we trace the
changing discursive fields surrounding particular racial groups. Finally, we explore the
coherence of the discourse around each race and ethnicity represented across American literature
before 1920, paying close attention to the ways in which various groups did or did not exist as
semantically unified groups at specific historical moments. Taken together, our three questions
show not just who was under discussion and how, but also the history—and historicity—of
racialization and ethnic thinking writ large.

Our goal in this paper is to identify and surface the racialized language of
American Fiction and to face the harms that it caused without eliding its
historical violence and force. At the same time, while we feel that confronting
such racism is important work, we do not want to perpetuate the harm that this
language, including many slurs, continues to cause to oppressed peoples,
particularly in the Black and Native American communities. To that end,
throughout this paper, we have adopted the practice of Brigitte Fielder, among
others, in representing particularly harmful terms using the following
convention: n[-----].1

Introduction
In many disciplines across the sciences and humanities, the “folk
conception” of race has become an important foil for the more accurate
understanding of race as a cultural construct. While scholars understand that
racial categories have an arbitrary, historically determined form with no basis in

biological reality, in the popular imagination race often retains the authority and
immutability of established science. Yet within the academy this folk conception
is often treated with the same casual, unsubstantiated confidence that is supposed
to characterize it. From the simplest issues (how many races do people think there
are?) to the most complex (how does biogeographical ancestry map onto racial
categories?), the presumed nature of the popular understanding of race varies
from one study to the next—whether because of actual variation across cultures
and eras, different research contexts, or lack of precision on the part of the
researchers. The pressing question is: What do the folk think about race?2
The methods of cultural analytics are especially well-suited for developing
an answer to this question. On the one hand, literary scholarship has developed a
robust set of tools for analyzing something like a “folk conception” as it appears
in cultural artifacts—as evident in the many forays into the cultural creation of
race undertaken by critics ranging from Henry Louis Gates and Toni Morrison to
Michael Hames-García and Robin Bernstein. On the other hand, to suggest that
American fiction has been a particularly active site for racial redefinitions does
not necessarily imply that authors were engaged consciously or deliberately in
this activity — nor that a novel must explicitly focus on race in order to contribute
to a widespread racial discourse. One particular benefit of computationally
analyzing a corpus of thousands of texts is the amplification of racial “signals”
that might, in an individual text and to an individual reader, be so faint as to
escape notice. Recent scholarly work and anti-racist activism has shifted both
empirical research agendas and political conversations away from individual
prejudice or conscious bias and toward structural inequities, emphasizing the
degree to which racism “lives” not in hearts or minds but in brains, bodies, and
institutions. Those who study identity are alert to the need to name and challenge
dominant narratives surrounding race, even (or especially) when those narratives
are actually instantiated only in partial, tacit, or compromised form.
For the study of representations of identity in fiction, quantitative textual
analysis offers a unique opportunity to access a kind of discursive unconscious
— the background of associative biases against which any individual author
constructs his characters. Our particular method of statistical analysis, which
records significant collocates of ethnic and racial target terms, mimics on the level
of language the implicit associations that social psychologists use to identify
unconscious biases and predispositions in their subjects, determining which
words are likely to show up near each other even when they are not necessarily
deliberately linked.3 Insofar as our statistical analysis remains insensitive to

29

REPRESENTING RACE AND ETHNICITY IN AMERICAN FICTION

authorial intention, it represents, on one level, a loss of complexity—but it also
makes possible a shift in scale that allows us to identify patterns of racial
discourse too diffuse to be perceptible. This process not only gives us a better
sense of the contours and content of “the racial unconscious” (in Eric Lott’s
phrase) across a wide range of ethnic groups; it also provides crucial empirical
evidence and historical depth for claims of bias in representation, revealing
racism’s place in the longue durée of American attitudes. As in the Freudian
unconscious, racial associations here assume a kind of absolute value that
disregards negation: the statistical link between the words “negro” and its most
negative valences for instance, which can be found in table 1 below, can be
bolstered both by novels that depict Black characters in these ways and by works
(like, for instance, To Kill a Mockingbird) that raise these associations in an
ostensible attempt to undercut them. As in the “cognitive nonconscious” sketched
by Katherine Hayles (2017), on the other hand, these associations represent not
so much affective attitudes elaborated over the life of an individual, but epistemes
emergent from unguided (but deeply unequal) systems. To the idea of
unconscious racial cognition, then, we would add something like Michael Omi
and Howard Winant’s concept of racial “common sense”: “a way of
comprehending, explaining, and acting in the world” that, through constant
“racial projects” that differentially distribute meaning and resources, constructs
race as something obvious, visible, and determinative.4 The product of constant
collective effort, but often experienced by the individual as effortless and
ineluctable, this common sense would emerge, we wagered, as a kind of
background noise in the nineteenth-century American novel that our statistical
methods could amplify.
In this paper, we cash in on this promise of the literary digital humanities
to reveal this background through an analysis of racial and ethnic language in
about 18,000 novels published in the United States from 1789 to 1920. Drawn
from the Gale American Fiction collection, which is based on scholarly
bibliographies of that period, these novels represent the vast majority of all extant
prose fiction published in the country during the first half of its history. Beginning
with a list of racial and ethnic terms that we created, we track three things in this
corpus: 1) The frequency of those terms over time, 2) The words that tend to show
up near those terms, or their “collocates”, and 3) The coherence of the discourse
around each race and ethnicity represented by the terms. The first shows us which
races and ethnicities were under discussion during the long nineteenth century in
America; the second shows us how they were discussed. The last is more

30

J OURNAL OF CU LTURAL A NALYTICS

complicated, and leads to the major finding of this paper. Initially, we wanted to
know which racial and ethnic groups would be discussed most consistently over
time; for instance, would conversations about Irish Americans look the same in
1810 and 1910? Would stereotypes about Chinese immigrants change as Chinese
immigration itself increased? Would the words used to describe African
Americans undergo a massive change after the Civil War? In the course of testing
this concept, we reached a fundamentally different and more radical conclusion.
Rather than finding that the words surrounding groups of people changed or
didn’t change over time, we found that the groups only cohered as groups at
specific historical moments. In other words, many of the ethnicities we set out to
find did not exist as semantically unified groups throughout literary history; in a
sense, the number of races and ethnicities varied over time. Our chief historical
finding, then, is less about the discourse of, say, Irish Americans and more about
whether “Irish Americans” existed as a salient category at all. Taken together, our
three questions show not just who was under discussion and how, but also the
history—and historicity—of racialization and ethnic thinking writ large.

Results, Part 1: The Racial Field
Our quantitative approach to identifying the background discourse of race
in American fiction rests on our ability to seed our model with terms based on our
own scholarly understanding of this discourse. This allows us to statistically
situate our quantitative approach within the critical work on racial discourse in
America. Our initial step, therefore, was to create a list of fourteen racial and
ethnic categories and then populate each category with lists of relevant words, or
“target terms.” In both cases, we proceeded subjectively, albeit with the help of
our training in American history. The categories include broad racial/ethnic
groups (black, white, Native American), ethno-religious distinctions (Catholic,
Jewish, Middle Eastern and Muslim), geographical origins (East Asian, Eastern
European, German/Dutch, Irish, Italian, Latin American, Scandinavian), and one
catch-all field (Immigrants). Within each category we hand-selected target terms
associated with that group in historic American discourse. These terms range
from common terms like “Indian” or “migrant” to outdated technical terminology
like “octoroon” or “Mohammedan” to specific nationalities or ancestries like
“Sioux” or “Brazilian” to slurs. In all, we wound up with 208 terms spread
unevenly across the fourteen categories. This approach has its disadvantages.
31

REPRESENTING RACE AND ETHNICITY IN AMERICAN FICTION

Most notably, it is not comprehensive, but limited by our own specialized
knowledge. To take just two examples, in subsequent conversations with other
researchers in race and ethnicity studies, we have come to believe that we should
have included terms for Pacific Islanders and Filipinos; eliding those groups is an
important and unjustified oversight. Nevertheless, our initial goal was not
comprehensiveness—which is probably impossible—but a large-scale study of
race and ethnicity. Even given its important limitations, our approach
successfully established a terminology of race and ethnicity from which we could
begin to analyze a broader discourse. This goal also informs another apparent
weakness of our list: its ahistoricism. Our process did not differentiate a priori
between terms in use today and terms that seem to have dropped out of the
language in the early nineteenth century, and included terms that were unlikely
to appear in any great numbers in our corpus’s historical range—but this
ahistorical approach was necessary if we were to confirm or disconfirm
hypotheses about historical change. If a term that we thought of as taking hold in
the 1950s turned out to have an unexpected spike in the 1830s, we did not want
to miss it.
For our literary texts, we turned as mentioned to the Gale American Fiction
Corpus, a collection of 18,101 novels covering the period from 1789 to 1920.
Because it is based on two bibliographies (Lyle Wright’s American Fiction and
Geoffrey Smith’s American Fiction: 1901-1925), it is exceptionally reliable, and
covers nearly every work of long prose fiction published in the United States
during the periods it represents. Like any corpus, it also leaves some things out.
As the “long prose fiction” caveat suggests, the Gale corpus is composed of
novels or short story collections that were published as freestanding volumes; as
such, it doesn’t directly register the large quantity of fiction being published in
magazines during the long nineteenth century. This omission is particularly
significant when it comes to nineteenth-century authors of color, who were more
likely to publish in magazines than to be picked up by the overwhelmingly white
editors at major publishing houses.5 Martin Delany’s radical novel Blake; or, The
Huts of America, for instance, does not appear in the Gale corpus at all, despite
its literary and historical significance: Blake was serialized in The Anglo-African
Magazine and The Weekly Anglo-African between 1859 and 1862, but was not
published in book form until more than a century later, in 1970 (Delany 2017).6
This means that our corpus is significantly whiter than the body of all fiction
published in the long nineteenth century, since it shares its bias toward white
writers with the publishing industry itself. We hope that future research will add

32

J OURNAL OF CU LTURAL A NALYTICS

depth and precision to our results by comparing them with corpora composed
mainly of authors of color—but we also believe there is value in tracking the folk
concept of race in the works of predominantly white writers, since racist ideology
is primarily a white construction (at least in the United States). Precisely because
white writers have had claim to cultural hegemony, their representations of race
are, we wager, more likely to unselfconsciously reflect and indeed constitute the
constant background noise of racism.

Figure 1 Frequency (per 100,000 words) of terms describing racial, ethnic and ancestral groups in 25year slices of the Gale American Fiction corpus

The first layer of results shows the frequency of each of our terms over
time. In Figure 1, which reflects term frequency (scaled per 100,000 words)
within the Gale corpus, these numbers are shown at the level of the broad
categories. A few historical trajectories are immediately clear: terms associated
with Native Americans dominate racial and ethnic discourse in the first few
periods, before being matched and then surpassed by the “Black” category; “East
Asian” terms grow more and more frequent over the whole period; “Irish” stays
consistent throughout. Individual terms (Figure 2) provide a high-level window
into what is going on beneath the surface of the broader categories: certain words,
for instance (“native”, “Indian”, “chief”), dominate the discourse of Native
7

33

REPRESENTING RACE AND ETHNICITY IN AMERICAN FICTION

Americanness.8 These figures show one kind of racial and ethnic history: which
people were being discussed, specifically in literature. It does not show which
people were living in the United States; the convergences and divergences of
these two kinds of history show how racial and ethnic discourse responds to,
resists, and reshapes race and ethnicity.
.

Figure 2 Frequency (per 100,000 words) of individual terms in the Gale American Fiction corpus

At times the relationship is fairly straightforward, a window into literature
that responded to changing facts about the world. For instance, as Figure 3 shows,
the persistent presence of “Native American” as a broad category masks
substantial changes within the category. In the first period, the three mostmentioned nations are the Cherokee, Mohegan, and Choctaw—all of whom lived
(prior to Andrew Jackson’s Indian Removal Acts) east of the boundaries of the
Louisiana Purchase. The second period reflects a similar Eastern bias, with
nations like the Iroquois and Lenape (both largely Northeastern) in the top five;
at the same time, the Sioux reflect a slight move to the Northwest. By the latest
periods of the chart, nations like the Apache and Navajo have risen in the
rankings, corresponding with United States encroachment on their territory in the

34

J OURNAL OF CU LTURAL A NALYTICS

Southwest. Some of these terms are probably present for reasons having to do
with genre, especially the development of the Western toward the later periods.
Yet even that generic evolution appears to reflect the history of encounter; there
is no Western before the U.S. invades the West.

Figure 3 Frequency (per 100,000 words) of mentions of Native American nations

Even more striking is the substantial uptick in the 1815-1839 period across
all but two of the nations (the more western Kiowa and Navajo). These changes
are driven by relatively few mentions—just 159 for the word “cherokee”, which
tops this list for the period—because there were relatively few books being
published in the United States at all in this period; in the Gale corpus there are
only 820 total works published before 1840. One side effect of this graph, then,
is to highlight the importance of one writer who was quite prolific at the time:
James Fenimore Cooper, who alone is responsible for a third of the mentions of
all the nation words in this graph in the period, with substantial percentages of
five of them (“iroquois”, “lenape”, “mohegan”, “mohican”, and “sioux”)
including, unsurprisingly, more than 90% of the mentions of “mohican”. Here too
we see an interaction of the literary and the political that accords with Jill
Lepore’s argument that literature had considerable agency in the
contemporaneous process of Indian Removal: “While ... Americans everywhere
read Cooper’s Leatherstocking Tales by the fireside, the federal government
35

REPRESENTING RACE AND ETHNICITY IN AMERICAN FICTION

sought support for removing eastern Indians west of the Mississippi partly by
invoking images like those popularized in Indian plays and Indian fiction.”9 When
it comes to Native Americans, there is good reason to believe that America’s
literary imagination was deeply entangled with its imperial march west.
Analysis of our other categories shows a different pattern. The census has
detailed data about the national origins of the American population from 18501930 (see Figure 4).10 In some cases, this data does appear to correspond

Figure 4: U.S. Population Claiming National Origin in Countries Belonging to Our Categories (source: U.S.
Census)

with literary presence; Scandinavians, for instance, appear in American towns at
a fairly similar rate to their appearance in American novels. But this is often not
the case. German and Dutch respondents are on the wane heading into 1920,
especially as a percentage of all foreign-born Americans; yet their category
grows over the same period in our data. This could simply reflect a lag—
perhaps novels only reflect new populations after they have been around for a
few decades—but it fits in with a general disconnect that is particularly
pronounced when comparing categories on a relative basis. This is most evident
with the East Asian category, which triples in term frequency from the first
period to the last. Immigration from China and Japan really did grow
tremendously over this time span, even after the severe limitations imposed by
the Chinese Exclusion Act.11 Yet it remained a fairly small fraction of all
immigration; it is dwarfed, for instance, by Eastern European and Italian
immigration in the last two periods. In the literature, the Eastern European
category grows a little, and the Italian category stays about the same, but the

36

J OURNAL OF CU LTURAL A NALYTICS

East Asian category easily outpaces both. The literary discourse simply does not
reflect racial and ethnic reality in any straightforward demographic sense. This
will seem intuitively correct to anyone familiar with the toxic “Yellow Peril”
rhetoric that proved so pervasive in American politics through the latter half of
the 19th century and first half of the twentieth, even as immigration from the
regions at the center of the imaginary peril was severely curtailed. In moments
like these, when the discourse diverges from the demographics, we have a
window into the operations of race and ethnicity as culturally determined
categories; literature does not simply respond to the world, because it is too
busy helping to create it.

Results, Part 2: The Racial Unconscious
While the simple appearance of our set of terms in this corpus is illustrative
of the presence of racial or ethnic discourse in American Fiction, it does not
reflect the interrelationships, the points of contact and divergence, that represent
the evolution of this discourse over time. After all, we also seek to uncover the
historically contingent semantics that attach to various descriptors of sociocultural identity: how configurations of words attach to specific identities, and
how both these configurations and the identities they describe alter with time and
in response to socio-cultural shifts. Beyond simply registering how present a
word is at any historical point (which the frequency graphs above describe in
detail), the relationships between words (and between words and ideas) undergird
an understanding of the discourse of race and ethnicity that is both diachronic
(registering change over time) and inclusive of each word’s full range of meaning.
Depending on the relationships that we seek, two options are available for such a
quantitative analysis of language as we propose here.
Methods based on word embeddings12 use a modeling process (for
example, neural networks or least squares) to represent each word in a corpus as
a vector of arbitrary length that can be related by distance metrics (such as cosine
similarity) to other words represented by equivalent vectors. While there are
many advantages associated with this method (including the ability to add and
subtract vectors to achieve a more complex representation of word relationships),
there are two significant drawbacks for our project. First, as these models relate
words based on shared context, similarity is weighted more heavily on
substitutability rather than proximity. That is, in a gloVe model of a corpus such
37

REPRESENTING RACE AND ETHNICITY IN AMERICAN FICTION

as ours, the closest terms to “jew” (a descriptor of both an ethnic identity, a
practitioner of a religion and, at times, a racial epithet) are: “gentile”, “turk”,
“jews”, “priest”, “peddlar”, “jewish”, “trader”, “merchant”, and “dealer”. The top
term, “gentile” is the antonym of “jew”, highly placed because it shares many of
the same descriptive contexts. The list also includes plurals and adjectives for the
word, as well as other near Eastern ethnic groups, all of which share similar
contexts. While vector math may be able to assist us in disambiguating antonyms,
grammatical forms, and geographically proximate groups, the specific operations
required would always privilege one set of connections over another (for
example, subtracting “religion” from “jew” gives a list of secular professions, and
adding “race” gives a list of other minority group names used in similar contexts).
Secondly, and more importantly, we are unable to reconstruct the specific logic
behind any of these groupings, beyond the general fact of shared context. If we
seek to reconstruct not just which words were associated but why they were
associated, we need to be able to examine their contexts in detail. A word
embedding model can suggest similarities, but only as the result of aggregate
contexts, making it a blunt instrument with respect to historical differentiation
and the nuance with which these terms were deployed by authors.
For this project, then, we elected to examine the relationships between our
terms through collocate analysis.13 The relationship of a word to a collocate is
proximal, and by comparing the frequency of each word as a collocate of our
target terms (here, words within a 10-word horizon before or after each target) to
the frequency of the word overall in the corpus, the significance of each collocate
can be calculated. Through this method, two words are related if they appear
within the horizon significantly more than can be explained by chance occurrence
based on either word’s frequency throughout the corpus.14 Following the above
example, the 10 closest words to “jew” are “renegate”, “gentile”, “jewing”,
“gaberdine”, “spindler”, “maimon”, “scythian”, “confucian”, “herodian”,
“monish”. Again, “gentile” is high, but now surrounded by words speaking to
religious apostasy and the origins of the Jewish people in the ancient Middle East.
Rather than the plural, it reveals the verb “jewing” that uses the identity as a slur.
Not only does this list better capture the complexity of associations linked with
the identity itself, but the principle of connection—they are all words that appear
in the immediate vicinity of “jew”—better enables us to trace the meaning of each
of these terms back into the texts that established it, capturing both associative,
as well as syntagmatic, relationships. Put simply, it allows us to return to
reading—to interpreting these associations as they appear in natural language—

38

J OURNAL OF CU LTURAL A NALYTICS

in a way that word embedding models do not. For these reasons, we chose
collocate analysis to trace the associations we sought.15
As a final stage in our analysis, we filtered the resulting collocates through
the Oxford English Dictionary wordlist, retaining only words that appeared in
that list (while excluding stop words). Our choice meant that we would lose many
character names from our analysis; however, given the relatively poor OCR
quality of the Gale corpus, we felt that this step was a critical means to readability
in the results. In the Gale corpus, this process yielded 26,976 unique distinctive
collocates.16 At the length of a novella (Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea
is only 26,600 words, of which about 2,500 are unique), this list proved
unmanageable to parse on a term by term basis. Even when filtered for the most
significant collocates (those with an observed/expected of greater than 100, or
those that appeared more than 10 times overall, which is the list that the below
tables are drawn from), there were still more terms than were comprehensible on
the human scale of reading. After studying some examples of the most striking
collocates, then, we elected to use a set of summary statistics to assist us in our
analysis, on the one hand using the collocates as a means of assessing the
connections (or similarities) of our target terms and, on the other hand, using these
collocates as a basis for ascertaining the overall clustering of each target race term
across our periods, as we will describe in our results.
It is worth taking a moment to recognize a few conceptual limitations of
this data. Early on, we were forced to acknowledge a surprisingly difficult
problem: what to do about the words “black” and “white”. Both are essential to
the discourse of their racial groups; both are also ordinary color terms used in a
wide variety of non-racial circumstances. Indeed, our analysis of target term
collocation (see below) indicated that the term “white” mostly did not reflect
discourse about white people. This corresponds with a disproportionate absence
of whiteness markers in general: a huge majority of the characters in our corpora
are white, but their whiteness is simply assumed; they are racially invisible to
their authors and each other. (See the end of this section for a more lengthy
discussion of the circumstances in which whiteness does become visible in our
corpus.) There was no clear right answer to this dilemma, not least because color
words can signify race even when they aren’t modifying human characters, as
Toni Morrison points out in Playing in the Dark—in one of the most powerful
moments of racial discourse in 19th-century fiction, “white” is a collocate mostly
of “fog”— and as segregationists in Alabama proved when they raised an uproar
against the 1958 children’s book The Rabbits’ Wedding because of the fear that

39

REPRESENTING RACE AND ETHNICITY IN AMERICAN FICTION

its black and white bunnies were tacitly promoting interracial marriage.17 In spite
of these important caveats, in the end we elected to remove the words “black”
and “white,” which seemed based on our collocate list to be more indicative of
literal color than of race.18 Moreover, because we did not grammatically parse our
corpus, we are unable to definitively determine the syntactic role typically played
by each collocate—a key shortcoming, given that many of our ethnic terms can
be used as nouns or as adjectives (for instance, “indian,” “mexican,” or
“catholic”). Computationally, then, we did not distinguish between a Chinese
child and a Chinese vase and “the Chinese” in the abstract: at most, a look our
collocates and target terms in context can give us hints as to whether particular
target terms are modifying characters, modifying objects, serving as individual or
collective nouns, and so on. Insofar as this minimalism drew our attention to
persistent slippages between persons, objects, and cultural abstractions, however,
the ambiguity it produced proved productive—and inspired further investigation
into the way that different ethnic terms connote animacy or inanimacy.
Despite these weaknesses, significant collocates gave us a useful window
onto the changing contexts in which the target terms were used, as well as the
different valences of particular terms within each group. For instance, within the
apparently monolithic racial category “Black”, closer analysis of collocates
across our historical range reveals very distinct discursive registers and
sociopolitical agendas from one term to the next. Perhaps most immediately
striking are the different groups of collocates associated with the terms “negro”
and “n[-----]”.

Table 2: Top filtered collocates of “n[-----]”

The collocates linked to “negro” show a mixture of terms associated with both
racist and anti-racist political rhetoric: insurrections, carpetbaggers, and
amalgamation, yes, but also enfranchisement and disenfranchisement.19 Whether
the rhetorical goal is to expand or to curtail African Americans’ rights, this is
clearly the language of “the negro problem,” of black-white race relations as a
41

REPRESENTING RACE AND ETHNICITY IN AMERICAN FICTION

prompt for deliberative argument and civic action. The collocates associated with
“n[-----],” by contrast, evoke not the public sphere but the private (if those two
can be differentiated in the context of slavery and Jim Crow): a world of dialect
and colloquialisms (wich, cust, dat, lub), of regional slurs and idioms (woodpile,
bluegum), and, most distinctively, of interpersonal affects and behavior patterns.
The conjunction of onery and sassy as collocates, together with masser and
massa, establish a kind of narrative script associated with this term, one in which
a playful or recalcitrant slave interacts comedically with a white authority figure.
Although onery and sassy might be rendered in an attempt at southern AfricanAmerican dialect, they describe predictable attitudes of black subordinates as
seen from the perspective of a white person. In addition to their distinct discursive
registers, then, we see that “negro” and “n[-----]” differ in their potential use in
group self-determination: the latter anchors a discourse applied to AfricanAmericans from without rather than generated from within, while the former
seems more closely split between the two.20
In this latter respect, it is instructive to compare “negro” with another target
term, “slave.” As with “negro,” the collocates of “slave” seem ethically and
emotionally ambivalent: terms like manumission and emancipate (and, again,

however, “slave” encompasses a set of collocates that serve to demarcate the line
between black and white, enslaved and free: quadroon and octoroon are
significant collocates, as are freedman and bondman. Reflecting a somewhat
narrower historical period than “negro,” these terms sketch out a semantic field
that aims to police the boundaries of racial identity and political citizenship by
focusing attention on liminal cases: individuals of mixed race and ambiguous
political status, or those who have recently experienced a change in status
(freedman). It is a discourse based on the close physical proximity and socioeconomic entanglement of dominant and oppressed racial groups, standing in
stark contrast to the collocates that we found for the target term “african,” which
instead evoke a script of exoticism and peripheral contact: explorer, colonization,
jungle. Knowing this, one might expect “ethiopian,” another target term, to center

REPRESENTING RACE AND ETHNICITY IN AMERICAN FICTION

a similar semantic field, with some modifications based on Ethiopia’s relative
insulation from colonial takeover—but here, instead, we found an entirely
different thematic cluster: serenaders, songster, melodeon, minstrels … It was
not until we learned of the existence of a prominent and much-imitated blackface
minstrel troupe called the “Ethiopian Serenaders” that we began to make sense of
the cluster. Given the lack of overlap between genetic ancestry and cultural
models of race, it perhaps should not be surprising that seemingly nested racial
and ethnic categories can in fact occupy almost entirely disconnected semantic
regions—but it was nonetheless startling to find this combination of local
thematic coherence and global heterogeneity.
Since the fourteen categories into which we grouped our hundreds of target
terms were more divisions of convenience than considered hypotheses, it is to be
expected that not all of the categories would be either as internally rich or as
thematically interconnected as “Black.” We created a single category for
“German or Dutch,” for instance, but found little semantic overlap between those
two nationalities: “german” collocates clustered around intellectual culture
(rationalism, universities, kultur, goethe) and war (bombed, militarism,
submarines), while the “dutch” were mostly represented as navigators and
merchantmen. Our “Eastern European” category, on the other hand, does show
internal semantic coherence, although not necessarily in the form we expected:
from “russian” to “polish” to “hungarian,” these target terms conjured up the
language of political radicalism and of classical music in equal numbers, with
pianist, waltz, and ballet counterpoised against nihilist, revolutionist, and refugee.
The absurd aptness of these collocates hints at the potential for interpretive work
on this data to become a kind of spot-the-stereotype parlor game: collocates of
“dutch,” after all, also included phlegm, cheeses, and windmills. The semantic
content of these European ethnic collocates is uninteresting, almost by design:
even an individual who has worked hard to counteract her own tacit racial biases
has probably not extended that work to these far less poisonous (and, often, quite
locally positive: kultur!) associations with white ethnic groups. In the absence of
the horror that stems from systematic racial oppression, the concentrated
stereotypes represented in our European collocate data elicit a kind of amused
recognition—of course Russians are ballerinas and revolutionaries—that gives a
contemporary reader some uneasy sense of how a white American reader in the
1840s might have reacted to seeing the collocates of, for instance, “d[----]”
(banjo, yah, massa). While the mechanisms behind this recognition might be
similar, however, their affective divergence for a contemporary reader reflects a

44

J OURNAL OF CU LTURAL A NALYTICS

genuine difference between the categories, as we will see below: our historical
findings suggest that the semantic associations of the “Black” and “Native
American” categories are indeed far more durable (“stickier”) than those of
European ethnicities, implying that these stereotypes retain a greater potential for
insidious action.
In the aggregate, our collocates reveal something about the linguistic and
semantic structure of stereotypes, irrespective of the particular group in question.
In keeping with social-psychological research on stereotyping, which suggests
that stereotypes function by attributing an individual’s behavior to traits rather
than situations, our findings point toward the hypothesis that adjective-noun pairs
may constitute a particularly salient locus for ethnic stereotypes.21 While
collocate analysis alone does not allow us to determine which words are
associated with, say, “oriental” as noun vs. “oriental” as adjective, collocates
themselves tend to be nouns and adjectives rather than, say, verb forms: we have
a perplexing “oriental” or an “oriental” face, a handsome “mulatto” or a “mulatto”
woman. Indeed, using ethnic terms to characterize objects or abstractions seems
to be as important a force in the development of stereotypes as the use of
descriptive adjectives to characterize ethnicities; while psychological research
might have led us to expect adjectives as collocates of ethnic terms (say,
passionate for “italian”), many of our most significant collocates were nouns
likely being modified by the adjectival term. So, for instance, we find future as a
collocate of “anglo-saxon” and powers of “european”—high-minded abstractions
sketching out the fate of the white race—whereas “chinese,” “japanese,” and
“oriental” are more likely to be associated with concrete nouns, especially for
commodities and aesthetic objects: butterflies, calligraphy, silk, tea, illustration,
verses. The latter results, which echo Anne Anlin Cheng’s thesis on the role of
“ornamentalism” in constructing East Asian and Asian-American women’s
identities, suggest that it is not only as descriptors of characters or of groups of
people that our ethnic target terms come into play; racial and ethnic background
discourse can tinge a rug or a teapot as readily as an individual.22
When ethnic terms do attach to persons, whether named or unnamed, our
collocate data shows that ethnicity does not combine as seamlessly with other
identity markers as one might assume. Although any racial background can
theoretically be assigned to either male or female characters, for instance, our
collocates showed a significant preference for some ethnicity-gender
combinations over others, revealing intersectionality in action.23 The collocate
man was most likely to be associated with racialized terms in the “Black” and

45

REPRESENTING RACE AND ETHNICITY IN AMERICAN FICTION

“Native American” categories—“colored,” “indian,” “d[-----],” and “i[----],” for
instance. Shifting to feminine collocates, however, one finds an increased drift
toward exoticism and a faint tinge of sexualization: both woman and girl are
significant collocates of “slave,” for instance—emphasizing female
subordination and lack of power—while such diverse ethnicities as “irish,”
“german,” “chinese,” “mexican,” “arab,” and “hebrew” also have female
collocates. Given the prevalence of the “tragic mulatta” storyline in American
fiction, it is particularly appropriate to find woman as a collocate of “mulatto,”
hinting at the sexualization of light-skinned African American women in many
nineteenth- and twentieth-century American fictions.24 And girl in particular
frequently appears as a noun modified by an ethnicity: the “Mexican girl,”
“Indian girl,” “Chinese girl,” and “Arab girl” are in an important sense
interchangeable—all similarly eroticized, all defined primarily by their distance
from an implied white male protagonist. One telling line from Louise C.
Ellsworth’s 1892 romance Furono Amati reveals the misogyny that underlies and
feeds upon these racialized caricatures: “he hated girls in general,” the narrator
tells us of a focalizing character—“the genus girl of which ‘Irish Lizzie’ was a
specimen.” Tellingly, “Irish Lizzie” is invoked in invidious comparison to a
beautiful girl that our hero does admire; though this “Isabel” is not explicitly
racially marked, her “liquid blue eyes” and “golden halo of curls” strongly point
toward a white Anglo-Saxon identity, indicating how readily sexist ideals can be
invoked to enforce racial hierarchies (and vice versa).25
The slightly different target terms associated with woman and girl,
moreover, suggest that age as well as gender has a relationship of mutual
influence with racial and ethnic identity. Young, for instance, is a collocate of
“italian,” while old attaches to “dutchman,” echoing the relative historical
moments at which these two ethnic groups immigrated to the United States (at
least during the 1789-1920 period of the Gale corpus).26 Interestingly, many
slurs—including especially those from the Black category—have a preferential
association with old, which, an examination of collocates in context reveals,
directly modifies for the target terms in question: attaching “old” to a slur not
only emphasizes the degrading familiarity that the term is intended to convey,
but, in a postbellum context, reflects the plantation nostalgia that fictions by and
for white Southerners produced and capitalized upon. One significant exception
to the association of old with “Black” terms, however, is “mulatto,” which has
young as a collocate—again, perhaps, hinting at the vulnerability and sexual
desirability associated with that racial term, together with the implicit

46

J OURNAL OF CU LTURAL A NALYTICS

generational dynamic (one black parent, one white parent, one mixed-race child)
that it evokes. The link between young and “mulatto” also reflects a broader
tendency, revealed in contextual analysis, for young ethnically marked characters
to be represented as heroic and/or sexualized, from the “gallant young Cuban
Fernando Perez” to “a tall, graceful, and exceedingly handsome young Aztec
woman named Margarita Ayla” to “a handsome young Italian laborer who had
on his person no clothes whatsoever”.27 Even when characters whose ethnicities
are coded as young remain peripheral or are represented as sinister, they bear
semantic associations with physical health and beauty, quick wit, and the
potential for upward mobility: several “mulatto” servants are described as “young
and active,” “intelligent [and] gayly turbaned,” or “as attractive … as a Moorish
statue would be” even as they are narratively subordinated to minor roles, while
many a “young Jew” appears “pushing his way from the Ghetto to the places of
power”.28
In our corpus, then, we find a large cast of racialized stock characters
occupying not only particular ethnic niches but also predictable social positions
determined by gender, age, and foreignness. Where, in all this, is that dominating
figure of American history and literature, that maximally unmarked character—
the white man? A clue came to us when, investigating appearances of the
collocate man in context, we found that its association with a target term like
“indian” was driven by contrast rather than equivalence: instead of modifying
man as an adjective, “indian” tends to appear in these passages as a noun
positioned in opposition to the phrase “white man”. The same, it should be noted,
is true for “n[----]”—and the fact that it is these two categories, “Black” and
“Native American,” that nineteenth-century American authors explicitly contrast
to whiteness suggests a basic assumption of racial difference far more deep-seated
and dehumanizing than in the case of other ethnic groups.29 Indeed, while some
passages that insist upon this racial difference depict “the white man” and his
racial others as two unequal but human groups—as in the melancholic-genocidal
certainty of one novel’s declaration that “the white man and the Indian cannot
live together[, t]he latter dies while the first lives and prospers”—others use the
contrast to assign the racialized group to a not-quite-human status, sometimes
literally between white people and animals: another text describes “a sloop called
the Sea Fox manned by a white man, an Indian, and a dog.”30
Yet while these references, largely delivered in the narratorial voice,
overtly reinforce a white supremacist and misogynist system that positions white
men as the only fully human beings, the bigram “white man” often appears in

47

REPRESENTING RACE AND ETHNICITY IN AMERICAN FICTION

quite another context: the voice of racially marked characters themselves. These
references usually occur in represented speech, as when an enslaved character
remarks, “what a careless creetur’ dat white man is”—albeit in the context of a
deferential conversation with his “mars’.”31 At times, though, they even make
their way into a kind of free indirect discourse, as when a narrator partially enters
the mind of the character Chee Ming only to reinforce orientalist ideas of
mysteriousness and opacity: “It was impossible to guess what Chee Ming
thought” or to know “[i]f he had been holding any suspicion against the white
man who had ridden with him from the Yanggun gate.”32 In books written by and
(presumably) for white people, such passages suggest, whiteness becomes visible
only through the adopted perspective of a racialized character to whom these
writers ascribe wariness, animosity, or disdain. Yet far from actually opening up
space for a critique of whiteness, these moments re-inscribe racial difference as
an inevitable fact legible even to those whom it most disadvantages, representing
a world in which racialized characters cannot escape whiteness even in their own
consciousness. By placing the acknowledgment that a man can (and indeed, in
the racist framework of these texts, must) be “white”—the least personalized,
recall, of all the racial and ethnic categories we tracked—in the mouths and minds
of racially marked characters, the white writers in our corpus foist the recognition
and maintenance of racial difference onto those who lose most from it, abdicating
responsibility even for their own so carefully constructed and defended
whiteness. To compel their own belief in their performance of racial logic, these
writers must also act the part of the audience—sometimes appreciative,
sometimes hostile, always (imagined to be) captive.

Results, Part 3: On “Stickiness”
Although the word frequency results in the first section are able to provide
a macroscopic overview of how much the language of identity was used over the
nineteenth century, and the collocate results offer a microscopic view of the
semantic richness of individual terms, we still lacked a way of understanding the
ways in which the constellations of associated words revealed through the
collocate analysis work in concert to define the various identities found in
American Literature. Although the collocate analysis reduces the problem from
18,000 texts to 144,000 words, the complexities in these relationships are still
48

J OURNAL OF CU LTURAL A NALYTICS

difficult to systematize. In particular, we wanted a way to capture two key
concepts that we combined under the rubric of “stickiness”: the tendency of
groups of collocates to “stick” to particular ethnic groups (which we came to call
Sticky 1) and the tendency of collocates to “stick” to each other as they travel
between identities (Sticky 2). In other words, Sticky 1 labels the consistency of
an association between a target term and its collocates over time: perhaps “irish”
is consistently associated with catholic, priest, and famine from the 1840s on.
Sticky 2, on the other hand, labels the consistency of collocate groups themselves:
perhaps catholic and priest stick together even when they attach to the target term
“italian,” while famine no longer travels with them.
To quantify how our collocates were related to each other based on their
textual co-occurrence — that is, their tendency to appear in the same frequencies
in the same texts — we used a Term-Document matrix to calculate the scaled
frequency (per 100000 words) of each collocate in each text, thereby placing each
collocate in relation to every other through the 18,202 dimensional vector of their
mutual frequencies in our corpus. The resulting model is a sparse vector
representation of collocate co-occurrence, which differs from the dense vector
models of word embedding analyses such as word2vec or GloVe by virtue of the
calculable association between terms, rather than a probabilistic model.33 Given
the size of our corpus, visualizations of the sparse vectors produce similar results
to a word embedding model with the benefit that our measurements of word
similarities are intuitively interpretable, and different embedding models can be
directly compared between time periods.
Given the immense complexity of the resulting data, we turned to tDistributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE) to create graphs that could
act as a window onto both forms of stickiness, showing how collocates associated
with each target group change their relationships to each other over time. The
advantage of tSNE over other methods of dimensionality reduction lies in its
distributed method of embedding observations within local structures while
retaining meaningful global patterns.34 The overall placement of clusters within
the graph, therefore, gave us the ability to interpret the broad trends in how
different clusters of words related to each other, while individual clusters revealed
their internal associations based on the individual associations of words they
contained.35 The relative positions of collocates in the clusters revealed by the
tSNE graphs for each of our 25-year periods offer an intuitive way to make
qualitative assessments about the semantic “regions” each group inhabits across
history. For instance, in the 1815-1839 period (see Figure 5.1), many of the terms

49

REPRESENTING RACE AND ETHNICITY IN AMERICAN FICTION

about Native American people appear in a coherent cluster, distinct from the
overall mass of collocates. The word “cherokee” appears near a number of words
suggesting rivers and forests (“canoes”, “thickets”, “furs”, “woodsman”),
relatively eastern locations and nations (“ohio”, “mohawk”, “mohican”,
“delaware”) and even another trace of Cooper (“natty”). By the 1865-1889 period
(Figure 5.2), the word “cherokee” appears nearer to words suggesting a new
geography (“montana”, “californians”, “coyote”) and a new genre
(“desperadoes”, “ranger”, “cowboy”). Tellingly, the word “reservations”, which
was not in the first t-SNE at all, now appears, almost overlapping the plural term
“cherokees”. Over time, then, the word “cherokee” undergoes a regional shift in
the tSNE that mimics a real-world forced migration to the west, and a literary
migration to the western.

Figure 5.2: Detail of t-SNE for the period 1865-1889. To make it more legible, this image has been filtered to
retain only those collocates that were primarily attached to terms in the Native American group.

A similar genre transformation informs a major cluster of collocates in our Black
group. The word “chile”, here most often a dialect spelling of “child”, tells the
story well. In the 1815-1839 period, it does not appear at all, and in general terms
from the Black category are widely dispersed, in our view failing to cluster in any
readily legible fashion. In short, the discourse of African Americans is not yet
especially internally coherent, nor is it obviously tied to any genres or clusters of
stereotypes a current reader would be apt to recognize. In the 1840-1864 period,
there are several large clusters on the periphery of the main mass of collocates,
including one area that clearly centers around ocean tales and another that is
highly indicative of religious terminology. The word “chile” appears in the
vicinity of a similarly well-defined new cluster, near words like “mammy”,
“masser”, and “missus”. A nearby island is predominately a cluster of dialect
words, and the word “banjo” appears as well. In these groups we glimpse the
beginnings of the discourse of the “Happy Slave” narrative, in which slaves are
figured as comical, carefree figures under the benevolent care of white masters.36

51

REPRESENTING RACE AND ETHNICITY IN AMERICAN FICTION

Figure 6.1: Detail of t-SNE for the period 1840-1864

By 1890-1914, the literary significance of this semantic cohort has become
overwhelmingly clear, as a huge, self-contained landmass off the coast of the rest
of the collocates amasses not just dialect, slurs, and a grotesque kind of affection
(“mammy” now sits right next to “honey”), but the dramatic influence of a
specific author: “brer”, “rabbit”, and even “remus” appear nearby. In other words,
the hypertrophy of this semantic space coincides with the growing popularity of
Joel Chandler Harris and similar plantation tales, which deform African
American reality as a means not just of propagating racism, but of making it, for
white audiences, fun. In these graphs, we can watch the messy, opportunistic
conceptual system of racism develop into its now-well-known literary discourses.
Part of this specific narrative is that absence of obvious Black clusters in
the earliest periods. In all of our graphs, words typically cluster on a topical basis;
a small group in the 1815-1839 period, for instance, includes “camp” as a
collocate of the Middle Eastern and Muslim group, “troops” from the Black
group, “battle” from the Native American group, and “soldier” from the Eastern
European group. These words are clearly organized by their connection to war,
rather than by an overwhelming racial or ethnic logic. Large, coherent clusters
like the Native American western collocates or the African-American dialect
collocates are much rarer. In fact, the selection of those two racialized groups for
the examples above was quite deliberate; for other ethnicities, these longstanding,

52

J OURNAL OF CU LTURAL A NALYTICS

Figure 6.2: Detail of t-SNE for the period 1890-1914

easily visible clusters simply do not exist on the same scale. Qualitatively, this
might suggest a distinction between the discourses of race (centering on legally
and phenotypically “othered” Native Americans and Black Americans) and
ethnicity (centering on “everyone else,” meaning, in this period, mostly people of
European ancestry). If this explanation is correct, our t-SNEs would provide
indirect evidence for Eric Foner’s claim that that “immigrant groups suffered
severe discrimination, but being discriminated against did not make them nonwhite.”37 In any case, however, the result certainly points to the historical
contingency of these groups in the first place. We can only truly assess the
stickiness of our collocates by answering a bigger question: whether, in any given
period, there was even a group for the collocates to stick to.
To answer this question we require a different way of measuring stickiness:
rather than measuring whether individual collocates cohere to discrete clusters
over time, we need to instead measure how stable our groups themselves were
compared to other identity categories at a given time. That is, to what degree do
the groups in each of our 25-year periods a) contain a group of collocates that is
unique to that group (not shared among other groups of collocates), and b) have
a significant overlap between the collocates of their constituent targets such that
they represent a holistic group (rather than a diverse set of potentially unrelated
identities)? For the first metric, we measured what we call here the external
distinctness of our groups: the percentage of collocates of each group that belong
53

REPRESENTING RACE AND ETHNICITY IN AMERICAN FICTION

only to that group. The more collocates a group contains that are unique to that
group, the more distinct it is: its terms denote the specific identity it names rather
than a range of possible identity-based subject positions. In the second metric, we
measure what we call the internal coherence: the percentage of collocates shared
among the target terms that make up that group. As in our analysis described
above, we found collocates based on their co-occurrence with target terms (for
example “african”), which we then group under broad identity headings (in this
case “Black”). This metric allows us to test how meaningful that overall group
heading is within a given period. If a group heading shares a significant
percentage of collocates among its constituent target terms, then by the logic of
our project, those terms are all working together to identify a single cohesive
group. Conversely, the less coherence among the target members of a group, the
less likely that group describes a single, stable, identity in that period.

Figure 7: External distinctness (a) and internal coherence (b) of groups based on shared collocates across
target terms. The size of the dots represent the number of collocates in each group.

Figure 7 shows the graph of both external distinctness (a) and internal
coherence (b) for our groups at each of our individual periods. In a), the higher
the group’s identifier, relative to the other groups, the more unique the words in
that group are, and the more distinct the group. In b), the higher the group, the
more coherent it is: more terms are shared among the collocates of each of its
target members. Within each period, this graph shows substantial differences in
54

J OURNAL OF CU LTURAL A NALYTICS

the coherence of each group. Most notably, the Black and Native American
categories are consistently more coherent than the other groups across both
metrics, with the Black category containing collocates that overlap the least with
every other group, and the Native American category containing collocates that
form a tight, interlinked discourse among our target terms. And as we near the
later periods, there is a rise in the prominence and coherence of the Chinese/East
Asian category, one that accords with our sense in other areas of this project that
literature was increasingly focused on and discursively consistent about this
group in the latter half of the 19th century. In other cases the categories
themselves seem to fail; the Middle Eastern/Muslim category, though extremely
high in internal coherence in the middle periods, has quite poor external
coherence overall. This likely owes something to its substantial overlap with the
Jewish category, which in turn probably reflects a pronounced Biblical discourse
that recurred throughout our time periods and entangled discussion of Jewish
people (and the Middle East) with a particular set of valences that were not always
racialized/ethnicized in the same way as, say, a Natty Bumppo or Uncle Remus
story. Most apparent of all, the graph shows fluctuation. Differences in corpus
size make it difficult to track any one group over time; later periods just have
many more words in total, and this drives many of the changes in collocate
behavior. But we can say that the relative rankings are very different from one
period to the next; sometimes the Native American and Black categories are
farther away from the crowd than at other times; sometimes Irish is higher than
Scandinavian, and sometimes it is lower; and so on. The specific mix of racial
and ethnic discourses changed dramatically over the course of the long 19th
century.
These final results point to a few linked conclusions. First, they support our
sense that the discourse surrounding Black Americans and Native Americans was
uniquely coherent and distinct in comparison with the language applied to other
racial and ethnic groups. We attribute this finding to differential racialization:
while most of our target groups retained at least some association with ethnic
identity (national heritage, a shared language, and so on) over the course of the
nineteenth century, white discourse around people of African and indigenous
American ancestry deemphasized these ethnic markers in favor of biologized
racial characteristics. Indeed, these categories functioned in part to erase
distinctions among, say, Wolof and Igbo speakers, or members of the Sioux and
Apache nations. Although the distinctions between race and ethnicity articulated
in footnote one were important to explaining the logic of our target terms, we did

55

REPRESENTING RACE AND ETHNICITY IN AMERICAN FICTION

not expect our collocate data to differentiate itself consistently on the basis of
ethnic or racialized groups; on the contrary, we chose our groups under the
assumption that each of them had been racialized during at least some part of the
long nineteenth century. These group results are thus particularly striking, and
while it is important not to identify the internal coherence and external
distinctness of a discourse with racialization itself, our findings certainly support
the idea that non-Black or Native American ethnicities—whether European, East
Asian, Latin American, or Middle Eastern—were discursively permeable in a
way that Black and Native American identities were not. Since much discourse
around demographic change in America still assumes that what Robert Blauner
calls the “framework of immigration and assimilation that is applied to European
ethnic groups” works equally well for all other racial and ethnic identities, the
distinctness of discourse around our Black and Native American categories is
significant—as is the relative indistinctness of most ethnicities.38 Rather than a
number of discrete groups that move closer to or further from an unmarked
neutrality as the ethnicities they represent are more or less othered by white
Americans, we find a relatively fluid “ethnic” discourse—similar to “ethnic”
cuisine in its status as simultaneously marked and generic—largely separated
from the much larger and more internally coherent discourses of blackness and
“indian-ness”.
Many mainstream and authoritative representations of race, ethnicity, and
ancestry—the U.S. Census, for instance, or the results of a DNA test—represent
these human population categories as relatively symmetrical. That is, “Black,”
“White,” “East Asian,” “Native American,” and so on label different clusters of
variables in a coherently organized space; even though the content of each
category is different, they are all structurally similar (in that they label particular
genetic patterns, particular phenotypes, or whatever the case may be). Our results
suggest that, when it comes to literary language, racial categories are in fact
radically asymmetrical—not simply in valuation, but in form. Discursively, it is
not the case that positive or negative language attaches to preexisting kinds of
persons as their social fortunes rise and fall; rather, that rising or falling is itself
complexly indicated by the availability of coherent, discrete language to describe
those kinds of persons. Our results suggest that racial categories, despite the
veneer of common sense that gives stereotypes their apparent obviousness, have
often failed to achieve lasting consensus, particularly as components of an
overarching taxonomy. Instead, racial common sense, to slightly repurpose Omi
and Winant’s term, seems to be constituted by a number of freestanding character

56

J OURNAL OF CU LTURAL A NALYTICS

types that vary widely in discursive detail, narrative flexibility, and perceived
distance from normative whiteness.
This fact reminds us of the ultimate contingency and instability of racial
and ethnic categories, not only by comparison with the concept of a timeless and
unified human species, but by comparison with themselves over historical time.
In our contemporary moment, when some geneticists and philosophers of science
are seeking to recuperate the folk concept of race by identifying it with
“biogeographical ancestry”—asserting, for instance, that “what ordinary folk in
the U.S. mean by ‘race’” corresponds to a 5-category taxonomy that is echoed in
population genetics39 — it is especially important to underline that “what ordinary
folk in the U.S. mean by ‘race’” is itself neither fixed nor internally consistent.
This awareness can prepare us to ask different questions, and obtain more precise
answers, about the discourse of race and ethnicity in the contemporary United
States. By framing our current cultural moment, for instance, as a particularly
intense and aggressive episode in the longer story of the creation of
“Latiné/Hispanic” as a “race”, we can recognize the ways that language is being
used to construct an internally cohesive category of persons—just as it was for
the “Black” and “Native American” categories in the nineteenth century. That
solidification may take place both through the shaping of explicit policies
excluding members of this group from the category of “citizen” or “American,”
and through linguistic associations shared by both malicious actors and the people
resisting them. As we fight back against the former process, it seems important
to keep our scholarly eyes trained on the latter—to keep racialization in the
foreground, precisely so that it cannot slip into the background of common sense.

Our usage of the terms “race” and “ethnicity” and “ancestry” will both loosely follow that of Paula Moya and
Hazel Markus in their anthology Doing Race: 21 Essays for the 21st Century (New York: Norton, 2010), as well
as current usage of the terms in anthropological literature that explicitly takes race as its subject (see, for
example, Charmaine D. Royal, John Novembre, Stephanie M. Fullerton, David B. Goldstein, Jeffrey C. Long,
Michael J. Bamshad, Andrew G. Clark, “Inferring Genetic Ancestry: Opportunities, Challenges, and
Implications,” American Journal of Human Genetics 86.5 (2010): 661-673). That is, we will use the term
“ethnicity” to describe a social group based on shared nationality, language, religion, and other cultural markers.
We will use “race” to describe social groups based on phenotypical markers like skin color and the pseudobiological justifications that have developed to explain these markers. And we will use “ancestry” to describe
groups based on bio-evolutionary geographies that inform both global migration and immigration. In what
follows, then, “Polish” or “Congolese” will be ethnicities, “white” and “black” will be races, and “African” or
“European” will be ancestries. Occasionally, for the sake of brevity, we may use the term “race” to describe the

57

overarching system of human classification that results in our more specialized uses of “ethnicity” and “race”;
this usage will be clear from context. These distinctions should be understood as discursive artifacts rather than
as descriptors of inevitable reality.

This research is exemplified by the work of Jennifer Eberhardt, who has contributed to popularizing the
concept of implicit bias; see, for instance, Jennifer L. Eberhardt, Phillip A. Goff, Valerie J. Purdie, and Paul G.
Davies, “Seeing Black: Race, Crime, and Visual Processing,” Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,
87.6 (2004): 876-893. In recent years, both the methodology of implicit bias studies and the rhetorical use of the
concept in public conversations about racism have been critiqued by some scholars: Jonathan Kahn, for
instance, argues that implicit bias offers a convenient way to avoid addressing structural racism. While these
concerns about the rhetorical and political uses of psychological research seem quite warranted, the existence of
implicit bias itself has been substantiated across many types of psychological measures and tests and constitutes
a subset of the much broader, well-understood phenomenon of unconscious processing of perceptual
information. Moreover, critiques like Kahn’s suggest that implicit bias is flawed as a framework precisely
because it doesn’t sufficiently shift the focus away from the individual; we share that goal with analyses of
institutional racism. Jonathan Kahn, Race on the Brain: What Implicit Bias Gets Wrong About the Struggle for
Racial Justice (New York: Columbia University Press, 2017). For an overview of psychological methods of
evaluating implicit attitudes — including the most famous such tool, the Implicit Association Test (developed
by Anthony Greenwald) — see Bernd Wittenbrink and Norbert Schwarz, eds., Implicit Measures of Attitudes

Throughout our analysis, we approached questions of historical change by dividing our corpus into 25-year
segments. In the earlier nineteenth century, when relatively few novels were published per year in the United
States, this allowed us to accumulate enough texts to draw meaningful conclusions; even so, we ended up
discarding the first segment (from 1789-1814) because it simply did not contain enough text. In the later
segment of our corpus, 25-year chunks were small enough that the quantity of texts was not overwhelming. We
still took care, however, to normalize our word counts so that the sizes of the 25-year subcorpora did not drive
our results.

“Chief” was one of the target terms that, we soon realized, was perhaps too polysemic to tell us much about
racial discourse; its prevalence is partly accounted for by non-racialized uses (chief of police, chief executive,
“chief” as a term of address, and so on). As we discuss below (with respect to color terms), it was difficult to
decide what to do with such polysemic terms; ultimately, we left in “chief” because it did seem to capture a
substantial amount of discourse about Native Americans.

Note that this data reflects where respondents were born; it is not a measure of the number of immigrants in

This act was signed in 1882, and was not repealed until 1943, although legal Chinese immigration did not
resume in large numbers until the Immigration Act and Nationality Act of 1965. Our category “East Asian”
includes both Chinese and Japanese immigrants; increased immigration by the latter in the later periods of our
study counterbalances some of the decline in immigration by the former. For more on this, and on the “Yellow
Peril” rhetoric mentioned below, see Gordon Chang, “Eternally Foreign: Asian Americans, History, and Race”

To assess significance, we used a Fisher’s Exact Test using the frequency of a word as a collocate of a target
as the observed, and the probable number of occurrences of that word as a collocate of the target given its
overall frequency in the corpus. Significance was assessed using alpha=0.05.
15
Given the scale of the corpus, both methods, word embeddings and collocate analyses, begin to converge.
The sheer number of collocates captures both synonyms and antonyms, albeit at a lower significance than the
vector model; while the vector model reveals that many proximal words, over the length of the corpus, share

contexts, although again at a lower frequency. Given the interpretability of the collocates, however, this method
remained the most useful.

The actual number of collocates, including duplicates, in the table was 142,177, a staggering result.

We also removed “yellow,” which we thought might collocate with a racist discourse about people of East
Asian descent, but which turned out to be overwhelmingly literal. As with “black” and “white,” however, we
retain some sense that a yellow silk gown, for instance, is not merely a yellow silk gown but an indirect
evocation of Chinese culture and people, even when no explicit term referencing them is present.
19
The strongest connection to “negro,” measured by statistical significance, is of course the word at the top of
table 1. In order to avoid reinforcing the connection between this target and collocate, we name the term here in
a second sentence and well outside of a ten-word window: the word “rapist”. While this term clearly has a
strong negative valence and is important for understanding how Black figures were depicted in nineteenthcentury American fiction, it is worth noting that these two words appear together only 11 times. Further
investigation reveals that 8 of these uses come from Marion Curtis’s 1907 novel The Note of Discord. That said,
the word “rapist” appears in the corpus only 26 times and it is significant that this paring accounts for 46% of its
total mentions in our corpus. Whatever its cultural force, Curtis’s forgotten text still has an undeniable statistical
effect on the use of both words. These two important words really are linked, and it really is (at least within this
corpus) because of this one novel among many thousands of others. For researchers studying linguistic artifacts
at scale, the potential statistical importance of small numbers and single texts should occasion serious ethical
reflection.
20
In part, this may reflect the historical limitations of the Gale corpus, which stops in 1920; if we were to follow
the term “n[-----]” into the present, we may find that its partial and contested reclamation leads its semantic field
to bifurcate in a way that resembles that of “negro.”

disproportionate increase in East Asian terms even as East Asian immigration increased more slowly
(mentioned above); it would be interesting to investigate whether these periods of frequent East Asian
references correspond to chinoiserie/japonaiserie trends in fashion or interior decoration.

Such effects, as Sharon Block points out, were built into language itself at least as of the eighteenth century,
when advertisements for fugitive slaves and servants “integrated sex and race divisions” with terms like
“wench” (for African-American women) or “s[----]” (for Native American women) “that reframed their gender
into a silent component of their racial designation” (100). Sharon Block, Colonial Complexions: Race and

According to Eve Allegra Raimon, the “tragic mulatta/o” concept dates at least back to Sterling Brown’s 1937

tragedy of the figure’s fate” (5). Eve Allegra Raimon, The “Tragic Mulatta” Revisited: Race and Nationalism in

“Jew” also has young as a collocate, but “hebrew” is more strongly associated with old, hinting that the latter
connotes a religious and cultural tradition more than a particular demographic group — a hypothesis supported
by some other collocates of “hebrew” with a very high observed/expected rating: chaldaic, aramaic, syriac, and
septuagint. This suggests a bimodal set of associations with Judaism: the Biblical past, and an ethnic immigrant
group of the late nineteenth/early twentieth century present.

It is worth noting that at least one nonfictional genre seems to show the same pattern: Sharon Block has found
that eighteenth-century advertisements for runaway slaves or servants rarely referred to European-descended
people as “white,” but when they did, “it was a comparison to someone described as ‘Negro’ or ‘Indian’”
(Block, Colonial Complexions, 66).

in fact Jewish — “a Polish Jew peddler named Wolf” with “sinister black eyes.” In the context of the coastal
Maine towns (populated, as the novel soon shows us, by white New England Protestants) where Captain Wolf
runs his bootlegging operation, the more salient identity is indeed “Jew”; when compared to his “roving Micmac

As our interpretation relies on a visual assessment of the graph, we took into account the local distortions

Though this discourse reached its popular apotheosis in the post-Reconstruction works of Joel Chandler

served a clear pro-slavery rhetorical function. See, for example James Hall, The Harpe’s Head: A Legend of

being unique to Spencer, is characteristic of contemporary philosophical investigations of race.
