The present paper is a test case of how far computational sciences and Islamic
and Arabic studies can be “partners” in answering cultural-religious and
historical questions related to the Arab and Muslim world. The paper mainly
discusses methods that could help us computationally track, quantify, and
explain the development of religious concerns of reform as reflected in the wellknown Muslim reformist journal al-Manār (Lighthouse), published by the
Muslim reformer Muḥammad Rashīd Riḍā (1865-1935) from 1898 until 1935
in Cairo. We employ quantitative and qualitative methods based on alManār-corpus by using morphological processing, topic modeling in order to
examine the thematic co-occurrences of the topics and lexemes pertaining to
Muslim thinking and societies in Riḍā’s time.

In recent years, the field of Digital Humanities has become a challenge and
profit at the same time for history and cultural studies. The integration of
applied methods, encompassing inclusive distant and exclusive close reading
can provide multifaceted views of existing vast amounts of cultural and
historical data. Coined by Franco Moretti, computational distant reading
2
facilitates a broader perspective and visualization of vast quantities of data.
However, the validation of accuracy, contextualized within historical events,
necessitates a closer analysis of the associated texts and their historical context.
To clarify, distant reading provides an abstract overview by processing
digitized results in graphs and diagrams, requiring refinement through close
examination against the corpora and their historical backgrounds. Reading
and analyzing data, the research questions posed by computational scientists
and historians may not always align. Nevertheless, collaboration between
these fields is essential in the quest for novel answers to longstanding
3
questions and the development of mutually beneficial methodologies.

The current paper should not be construed as part of the ongoing debate
regarding the effectiveness of distant reading versus close reading per se.
Instead, this study serves as a test case to explore the extent to which
computational sciences and Islamic and Arabic studies can collaborate in
addressing cultural, religious, and historical inquiries related to the Arab
and Muslim world. The paper primarily delves into methods that could
computationally track, quantify, and investigate concerns related to religious
reform as reflected in the prominent Muslim reformist journal, al-Manār
(The Lighthouse), published by Muḥammad Rashīd Riḍā (1865-1935) in
Cairo from 1898 to 1935. Our approach employs both quantitative and
qualitative methods, utilizing the al-Manār corpus. We employ
morphological processing and topic modeling to scrutinize thematic cooccurrences of topics and lexemes associated with Muslim thought and
societies during Riḍā’s era.
This distant digital reading will be complemented by a qualitative historical
close analysis to contextualize these topics in relation to the events that
prompted them. In this case study, we will explore disciplinary connections
by experimenting with computational quantitative models alongside the
backdrop of historical qualitative evidence. Our objective is to uncover
overarching narratives through a combination of quantitative data, focusing
on recurring topics in al-Manār, and interpreting them through qualitative
micro-histories that offer a deeper understanding. This collaborative effort
seeks to evaluate the results of digital history against the traditional
interpretative reading of historical sources, using al-Manār as a case study.
Through this endeavor, we aim to bring statistics and algorithms closer to
human historical interpretations.
It is essential to situate this paper within the recent academic landscape of the
intellectual digital history of the Arabic renaissance (nahḍa). In his research,
Till Grallert explored digital history applied to the study of the late Ottoman
Eastern Mediterranean periodical press (1906-1918). Grallert uses the term
‘ideosphere’ as a spatial metaphor for understanding the periodical press,
referencing the realm of human ideas. This involves transcending individual
periodicals and engaging in a systematic study of the periodical press at
scale. Grallert’s essay is not limited to the specific case study but makes
use of early Arabic periodicals such as Buṭrus al-Bustānī’s al-Jinān (Beirut,
1876–1886), Yaqūb Ṣarrūf, Fāris Nimr, and Shāhīn Makāriyūs’s al-Muqtaṭaf
(Beirut and Cairo, 1876-1952), Muḥammad Kurd ʽAlī’s al-Muqtabas (Cairo
and Damascus, 1906–1918/19), or Rashīd Riḍā’s al-Manār (Cairo,
1898–1941). In his method, Grallert focuses on (social) network analysis and

stylometric authorship. When establishing a network of authors and texts in
these journals, he analyzes bibliographic data, not primarily focusing on the
contents of articles. The present work extends the analytical scope to include
the application of topic modeling on al-Manār. We use al-Manār as a case
study by employing topic modeling, which is mostly concerned with the
contents of the journal rather than the network of authors. Boğaç Ergene and
Atabey Kaygun produce a semantic mapping of Ottoman Fetva collections
by the Ottoman Chief Mufti Ebyssuud Efendi (1490-1574) by using topic
modelling as a tool. As a systemized compilation, the authors have a priori
knowledge of the ‘thematic categories’ included in the fatwas. Then they used
a modeling algorithm to identify ‘topics’ based on the relative proximities of
words and phrases that constitute the text. The method also provided clues to
5
broader semantic concentrations in the corpus. The authors stress that their
“article is methodological in nature. It proposed computational techniques
and approaches that successfully capture the substantive constituents of an
6
important Ottoman fetva collection.”
Normally speaking, topic modelling aims to “discover” issues in collections
of texts without requiring knowledge beforehand what topics might exist in
them. Also there is a challenge in the method of distant and close reading that
the reading of everything in the latter method seems impossible. However,
al-Manār has been closely studied and the frequent salient topics which
were discussed by its founder are highlighted in scattered secondary studies
that provide us with formal in-depth analysis. This knowledge will help
us experiment with the computational results of topic modelling, which
is actually meant to unearth evidence that already exists in the texts. In
this research, we therefore take a reverse approach to the standard historical
reading of al-Manār by first automatically clustering the data into topics;
and then trying to study the context for the results by narrowing the scope
to focus on the individual patterns or probably unexpected topics that can be
found in the dataset.
Why al-Manār? The al-Manār magazine was one of the most significant
reformist publications in the colonial age. It was founded in 1898 and
continued till the death of Riḍā in 1935. In his magazine, Riḍā wrote on
the Qur’an, Islamic reform, politics, as well as hosted other topics that rose
and fell with the ebb and flow of political, religious, and social events in
Egypt, his birthplace Syria and the wider Muslim world. During these years,
the magazine dominantly represented the trend of “Islamic modernism” or
“Islamic reformism” in its time. Historically al-Manār is thus a rich mine of

information and a good historical window about the Muslim world in Riḍā’s
age on various religious, cultural, political, social and literary issues. In its
general mission, al-Manār called for the preservation of Islamic beliefs and
religious practices without ignoring challenges of modernity. In other words,
his religious tactics were part and parcel of a broader reformist discourse that
tried to urge Muslims to accept specific tools of modernity without losing the
grip on their religious core beliefs and practices.
Around the magazine Riḍā gathered a plenty of associate writers who shared
with him similar reform ideas from North Africa to Indonesia and China to
Russia and Europe. In addition, it was one of the early Muslim magazines
that published Qur’anic exegesis and fatwas which made Islamic knowledge
accessible to many generations up till nowadays. In 1940 and at the request
of Riḍā’s family four issues of al-Manār were published under the editorship
of Hasan al-Bannā (1906-1949), the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood
in Egypt, despite the fact that neither al-Bannā nor the Brotherhood are
nowhere mentioned in Riḍā’s magazine.
Much has been written about al-Manār, but two recent works should be
mentioned here. Florian Zemmin uses al-Manār as a case study in order to
see how modernity developed in Islamic tradition in the colonial age. For this
end, he used the concept of ‘society’ and how it was defined and mobilized in
7
Riḍā’s magazine against its socio-political and intellectual contexts. Zemmin
made use of the computational tool PowerGrep in order to count the terms
related to the concept of ‘society’ and the ‘social’ (such as, mujtamaʿ, alhayʾa al-ijtimāʿiyya, ijtimāʿ, ijtimāʿīyya) in al-Manār . He recorded his
quantitative findings in order to see how these terms significantly increased
or decreased in their usage over the lifespan of Riḍā’s journal. Zemmin noted
that the frequency of the usage of specific terms are sometimes obvious
when it is connected to significant historical events, such as the controversial
8
abolishment of the Ottoman caliphate in 1924. While studying individual
lexical terms is useful, topic modelling, which we examine in this article, adds
another layer of complexity, and usefulness, by clustering words together,
similar to collocation analysis, which helps discover connected terms and
topics. Associating themes with time stamps helps track thematic changes
beyond the single lexical items.
In another study, Leor Halevi studied diverse fatwas by Riḍā in which
he answered many questions raised by Muslims from all over the world
dealing with then modern things, such as gramophone records, brimmed
hats, tailored trousers, lottery tickets, paper money, gigantic gongs, and toilet
paper, and how they (as mostly western) “crossed cultural and political

frontiers” in the colonial age. Halevi put al-Manār and its founder under
what he calls “laissez-faire Salafism,” by which he described Riḍā’s “good
tidings, which he spread far and wide, that adherence to the sharia’s original
spirit would empower modern Muslims to overcome hardship and rise to
9
affluence.” In that sense, al-Manār tried to provide Muslims with “a
common ethical framework” by which they could perceive their “local
10
entanglements with modern things.” He studied Riḍā’s fatwas as an “history
from below,” by employing “microhistorical investigations of particular
religious or legal questions in a local context and ends with reflections on
11
broader global patterns.”
The present approach will see how digital tools will help us understand
how al-Manār reacted to a globalized Muslim world by figuring out the big
historical picture of events and questions of modernity. By the use of topic
modelling, the paper will not produce a microhistorical top-down historical
investigations to Riḍā’s religious reform, but will offer a macro-historical
down-top approach; and through which close reading will follow in order
to examine the historical details of such automated topics. By this we will
apply the topic modelling as a method for studying modern intellectual
history of the Muslim world and the challenges the Arabic language poses to
computational methods. How far do graphical representations of the topic
modelling speak to a proxy to the historical social, political and religious
reality or to capture discursive change in al-Manār?

Data and Methods: Frequent topics and issues
Data Properties of al-Manār
For the purpose of this study, we have used the Shamela version of al-Manār
(https://old.shamela.ws/index.php/book/6947 ). This version of al-Manār
exists as an epub file comprising 4552 xhtml files. Not all of these have
textual content. We have preprocessed the magazine through extracting the
text from the xhtml using the Python BeautifulSoup library. The resulting
corpus has some very useful properties as a corpus: (1) it is large enough for
computational tools to glean insights. The magazine contains 3980 textual
files and 6.740.567 words, with an average of 1693.6 per document, and
(2) the documents are chronologically ordered, which makes it possible to
examine and track the historical changes in the dataset in a way that helps
historians see which events became prominent at certain points of time and
which faded away. Also the nature and availability of al-Manār in print and
digitally therefore make the magazine a unique historical source by which

we can reconstruct scattered information by analyzing its founder’s ideas and
major topics of religious Islamic reform on the basis of measuring patterns
of word (co)occurrence throughout the years of its publications. Although
the available digital version of al-Manār allows keyword search, this tool
cannot manually read and analyse the quantity of evidence for topics as topic
modelling.
12

In our examination of the al-Manār-corpus, we exclude Tafsīr al-Manār
for two reasons (1) Tafsīr is a category in its own right, and does thus not fit
naturally within our historical analysis framework, and (2) while the Tafsīr
is available in a digital format, it is not available as part of the Shamela
version. Also it does not have date information, which makes it hard to track
the influence of the political and social events on the tafsir. This may be a
worthy study of its own, and we plan to explore the possibility of such an
investigation in the future.

Throughout its 37 years of existence, al-Manār received contributions by
370 writers with Rashīd Riḍā himself contributing over 70% of the content,
which makes al-Manār more of a personal commentary by Riḍā on the
then current affairs. Other notable contributors include a certain ʿAbdul-Azīz
Muḥammad (72 articles), the Egyptian medical doctor Muḥammad Tawfīq
Ṣidqī (see below) (68 articles), extracts of famous works by the medieval
Muslim scholar Aḥmad ibn Taymiyya (37 articles), the Lebanese Prince
Shakīb Arsalān (1869-1946) (36 articles) and Rashīd Riḍā’s brother Sāliḥ
Mukhlis Riḍā (1884-1922) (29 articles). The inclusion of content by Ibn
Taymiyya indicates that Al-Manār had to recycle some old material with the
writing of Ibn Taymiyya being the most used outside of direct and indirect
quotations.

Topic Modeling for Arabic
Probabilistic Topic Modeling is a way of summarizing a collection of
documents into clusters of keywords, usually called themes. It uses cooccurrence statistics and the principles of distributional semantics to find the
13
14
most relevant words. In their research, Eid Mohamed and Emad Mohamed
used topic modeling to examine whether Egyptians still care about the Arab
Spring. They first collected a large corpus of Facebook comments, performed
morphological analysis and topic modeling. They then built a regression
model in which the independent variables were the probabilities of the topics,
and the dependent variable was the number of shares. Based on a ranking
of the themes based on the importance produced by the regression model,

they also ranked the various topics of interest in Egypt and found out
the Arab Spring ranked 16. In this article, we follow the same pipeline of
preprocessing, but without the use of regression analysis.
While topic modeling has been in common use for English language material,
Arabic poses special challenges to language processing in general. One main
reason for this is the rich morphology of Arabic, which leads to large
vocabularies, where many surface forms are various realisations of the same
word in different conjugations. Consider, for example, the word ‫فسنستخدمها‬
in Figure 1. The word translates into the English word “then we shall use
it” among other things. It is made of the conjunction f, the future prefix s,
the verb nstxdm, and the third person feminine singular object pronoun hA.
The vern nstxdm itself is made up of the prefix n (we) and the verb stem
stxdm (to use). It becomes now obvious that it may not be a good idea to use
these words as is in topic modeling since fsnstxdmhA and wsnstxdmhA will
be treated as two different words while they differ only in the conjunction
used. Conjunctions are normally discarded in building topic models. For this
reason, we perform morphological stemming before doing topic modeling
whereby we get rid of all the prefixes and suffixes, and maintain only the
lexical stem of lexical words (nouns, verbs, and adjectives)
In order to maximise the benefit of the automatic processing of al-Manār we
use a computational linguistics pipeline as follows:
First we use the al-Manār version distributed by Al-Shamlila library. This
is an epub version which is basically made of compressed xhtml files having
a clean and simple navigational structure. After uncompressing the files,
we extract the texts from the xhtmls through removing the boilerplate and
15
the markup tags using the Python Beautifulsoup library . The text files
come in lines matching the print version, which means that line breaks
are not representative of sentence boundaries. We use heuristics to detect
sentence boundaries to make the files ready for processing. Although sentence
boundaries may not be significant for topic modeling, the information
contained in these boundaries are useful for the morphological analysis
component.
Then Morphological Segmentation comes next. We have already established
the nature of Arabic words and the importance of segmentation above. We
use stems for building the topic models. Stems are produced by the Arabic-

SOS tools. Arabic-SOS uses Gradient Boosting Machine Learning algorithm
to perform word segmentation, and it achieves accuracy of 98.8%. on Modern
and pre-Modern Arabic.
The morphologically segmented texts are then passed to the stage of Topic
Modeling, which is a statistical method by which themes in a corpus can
17
be discovered. We use the Mallet topic modelling toolkit. Mallt is useful
for handling large amounts of data and for its ease of use in the Unix
command line terminal. In addition to the themes, Mallet also produces
detailed information about each document that we use for historical tracking
and probabilistic topic membership. The method recognizes distributions
across all words in the corpus of al-Manār. While each topic technically
comprises proportions of every word in that corpus, the tool features the
words with significantly higher frequency than others. It is assumed that
these words are thematically related; and this results in a list of its highestfrequency words as clustered under a probable topic. Given a large number
of documents, the Topic Modeling algorithm, which is a form of clustering,
produces groups of keywords that together represent a theme. For example,
the cluster {dog, cat, lion, tiger, fox} may indicate the topic ANIMAL
while {headache, fever, stomachache, joint_pain} may represent ILLNESS.
Each document in the corpus can have several topics ranked probabilistically
according to higher frequency of the main themes of the document. We can
say document A belongs to topic 1 with a probability of 17%, and to topic 2
with a probability of 14%. Given the dates of these documents, we can easily
track topics through time, which we do in this paper.
Having performed segmentation, author extraction, and topic extraction, we
can now associate dates with topics and also authors with topics. We can
now see which topics which authors took an interest in and at what time this
interest went up or down. We can thus have a computational history of alManār.

Detection of Topics and Trends
Combining the topics extracted by topic modeling and the information on
the dates of publication, we can now infer what topics pre-occupied the
editor(s) of al-Manār at a certain time. In order to make a balance between
digital methods and historical interpretation, we will contrast the digital
results with al-Manār content of topics that are more strongly associated
with Riḍā’s concerns of reform and his debates. We closely look at the

automated output in order to determine for each topic if it was pertinent to
the period of time under consideration, and to see if these results propose a
high degree of accuracy in highlighting leading themes in the corpus.

Categorization of topics
Choosing a bigger or smaller number of topics will give a greater or lesser
degree of granularity. The clusters below can provide a clear outline of the
corpus contents, its themes and proportions based on a qualitative inspection
of the distributions that were generated by a model of 50 topics. We should
note the terms seem unremarkable in isolation, but it is assumed that they
have significance when we recognise their repetitious presence as a series of
more specific genres and subjects:

Historical analysis of topic distribution
The method has captured various topics which are mostly related in a
meaningful way to religious, societal and political situation of al-Manār’s
worldview. By Glossing the salient themes as reflected in the individual
words, we observe reasonably coherent topics in various cases. We notice
that there are similar words and terms that are generated together under
different sets of topics words. By combining such multiple topics that are in
most cases semantically related, we can observe six general overlapping areas
in the fifty topics where al-Manār showed strong interest 1) Reform and

High Spikes in historical perspective
In this following experiment we try to check the formal internal validity
evaluation of the topics against the historical background of al-Manār and
its writers. In the following chart, we will try to plot the occurrence of
the selected topics over time. We closely look at 16 graphs where spikes are
highest in specific years, which indicate that the topics become more frequent
in this period. By close reading we shall see how al-Manār’s interest in
these topics was triggered by specific historical, religious, political or societal

discussions or events. It will be clear that the timeline and tokens of the
topics show solid lines indicating each topic’s contribution to the corpus in
these specific years. Against the historical background of the corpus, we shall
see if the dotted line or spike, which indicates the topic’s contribution to
the highest level, would match with contextual reality of Riḍā’s interests and
worldviews. As we shall see, to unpack these patterns, we shall use a closer
reading by surveying the temporal structure of each topic reflected in the
following graphs.

Figure 2. Topic 40 (0.10011)

Topic model 40 (0.10011): Al-Manār’s project of religious reform was
closely connected with the question of education and upbringing. In the early
years of its publication, we notice in the graph that there is a high spike
showing this topic. In this period, Riḍā published the Arabic translation of
L’Émile du dix-neuvième siècle by the French far-left politician and writer
Alphonse Esquiros (1812-1876) which was a response to Jean-Jacques
Rousseau’s Emile, ou de l’éducation and the latter’s ideas about childhood
18
and physical education. The translation was prepared upon the suggestion
of Sheikh Muḥammad ʿAbduh by the above-mentioned ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz
Muḥammad, a prosecutor at the Tribunal of the town of Zaqāzīq in the

Egyptian Delta. Esquiros’ work was successively published in a series in alManār under the Arabic translation of the French title “Amīl al-qarn al-tāsiʿ
19
ʿashar,”, and was later published as a book by al-Manār Press.

Figure 3. Topic 5 (0.10918)

Topic model 5 (0.10918): The two high spikes in this graph refer to 1911
and 1919. By glossing a general topic we see that the key-words refer to
“congresses” and their committees and resolutions. In both cases, we note
that in 1911, Riḍā was reacting to the Coptic Congress which was convened
at Asyūṭ (Southern Egypt) asking for equal rights of citizenship after the
assassination of the Coptic Prime Minister Buṭrus Ghālī Pasha in 1910 by a
member of the National Party, Ibrahīm Naṣīf al-Wardānī (1886-1910). This
period was one of the most critical points in the history of the MuslimCoptic relations in Egypt under the British colonial power. The Copts had
seen his assassination as the culmination of the anti-Christian propaganda by
Muslims. The Congress resulted in a petition summarizing Coptic demands,
20
which was presented to the Khedive and the British. In response Muslims

organized a congress under the name al-Muʾtamar al-Miṣrī ( The Egyptian
Congress) in Cairo. As a Muslim thinker, Riḍā immediately embarked on
responding to the Coptic demands in a series of articles in his journal by
which he also supported the Egyptian Congress. Riḍā later collected these
articles in his work, al-Muslimūn wā al-Qibṭ aw al-Muʾtamar al-Miṣrī
21
(Muslims and Copts or the Egyptian Congress). In 1918-1919 and in the
wake of the end of the First World War, al-Manār shed light on the Paris
Peace Conference and the Treaty of Versailles and their impact on the future
22
of Arab and Syrian independence.

Figure 4. Topic 43 (0.08339)

Topic model 43 (0.08339) contains keywords related to Mecca and hajj
sites and rituals. This reflects Riḍā’s Pilgrimage journey in 1916 which
Rainer Brunner correctly described as one of Riḍā’s ways of “conscious selfpromotion, against the backdrop of the First World War and the caliphate
23
discussion.” From October 1916 to May 1918, Riḍā published 10 serialized

This topic model 8 (0.0776) reflects a similar topic as the previous one.
The difference is that it captures other key-terms specifically showing Riḍā’s
specific treatment of the independence of Syria, Iraq and Palestine form the
British and French colonial yoke. The spike is also still somehow high in
1920-1921, which are the years when Riḍā became the vice-president of the
Syrian-Palestinian Congress (founded in 1918). This congress commissioned
a delegation to travel and represent their political case before the League
of Nations in Geneva in the summer of 1921. This should be highlighted
against Riḍā’s concept of the ‘Greater Syria’ which sharpened his longing for
Pan-Arabism and struggle against the imposition of the French Mandate in
24
Syria.

1922-1923, Rida wrote extensively about the caliphate, which Mahmoud
Haddad considered as “the culmination of Rida’s political and religious
thought” on his issue. All related articles in this period focused on the
subsequent dismantlement of the Ottoman caliphate by the Turkish
republican government and the re-imagination of the return of Caliphate
in Arabia. In Riḍā’s general view, the caliph should be a mujtahid and
a Qurayshite because it was the Arabs who spread the message of the
25
“Arabic Quʾrān” and defended Islam with their “swords.” In the same
period, al-Manār became a platform for many Muslim writers and political
thinkers who sympathised with the Caliphate, especially the well-known
Indian intellectual Abul Kalam Azad (1888–1958), also leader of the Khilafat
Movement, who also shared with Riḍā the belief in the necessity of the
caliphate as an institution that enforces Islamic law and protects the
26
boundaries of the Islamic community.

Figure 8. Topic 20 (0.05822)

Topic model 20 (0.05822) shows al-Manār’s interests in medical scientific
issue, the human body and health. In 1912-1916, the journal provided
most extensive discussions about modern sciences, written by Riḍā’s private
medical doctor Muḥammad Tawfīq Ṣidqī (1881-1920). Ṣidqī achieved
considerable prominence in al-Manār due to his writings on various subjects,

especially those related to the reliability of the Sunna, Christianity, and the
27
application of modern medical and scientific discoveries to Islamic concepts.
Besides, Ṣidqī became a lecturer at Riḍā’s Muslim missionary school of Dār
al-Daʿwa wā al-Irshād (the Society of Islamic Mission and Guidance). It
was a boarding school, which was primarily entitled to train two missionary
groups of people: the murshids (guides) for Muslims, and the duʿāh
(propagators) to defend Islam against missionary attacks. Ṣidqī was
authorized to teach the students in sciences, medical topics and biology, the
study of the Bible and the history of the Church. In 1914-1915 12 articles
were serialized in al-Manār under the title “Durūs sunan al-kāʾināt” ( Lessons
28
on the Habits of Created Beings).

Figure 9. Topic 37 (0.08641)

Topic model 37 (0.08641) is also related to health and diseases. However,
the spike goes high in 1926-1928 due to al-Manār’s interests in M. K.
Gandhi’s (d. 1948) and his thoughts on health. In these years, al-Manār
provided a serialized Arabic translation of Gandhi’s work, A Guide to Health,
prepared by the Indian-born intellectual Abdur Razzaq Malihabadi (d. 1959)
under the title “Kitāb al-ṣiḥḥa (Book of health).” As one of Gandhi’s most

Figure 11. Topic 38 (0.10653)

Topic model 28 (0.0723) and topic model 38 (0.10653) capture themes
related to Christianity, Christian missions, the Bible, the church and religious
fanaticism, which have become dominant between 1911-1915 according to
the two graphs. The reason for this historical fact is again the emergence of
the above-mention Tawfīq Ṣidqī on the stage of al-Manār and his prolific
contributions to Muslim polemics against Christianity and Christian
missionary activities of his time. In his response to missionary writings
on Islam, Ṣidqī used western works on Biblical criticism, and introduced
them to the readers of al-Manār. He referred to western writers, such
as the Englishmen Walter Richard Cassels (1826-1907), John Mackinnon
30
Robertson (1856-1933) and many others.

Figure 11. Topic 17 (0.09762)

Topic 17 (0.09762), which is related to the position and authenticity of the
Ḥadīth, jumps higher in 1920 and in 1925-1926, although it was relatively
present in the previous years. The prominence in 1920-1921 can be explained
that the young Egyptian Ḥadīth scholar and orator Muḥammad ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz
al-Khūlī (1892-1931) had published five long articles in a serial format under
the title “Tārīkh funūn al-Ḥadīth (the history of the sciences of Ḥadīth)” in
which he discussed the meaning, position, scholars, canons and history of

the Prophetic traditions in Islam. As for the second high spike marked in
1925, we closely read that a critical note was sent to Riḍā by a certain ʿAbd
al-Raḥman al-Jamjamūnī, a habitual reader of Riḍā’s journal from Egypt,
blaming Riḍā for his suspicion of the traditions narrated by the Muslim
Yemeni traditionists Wahb ibn Munabbih and Kaʿb al-Aḥbār, who were
considered to be the earliest authorities on Israʾiliyyāt narratives in Islam.
This triggered a debate between al-Jamjamūnī and Riḍā on al-Manār’s pages
on these historical figures and their authority in Ḥadīth. On the basis of
the branch in Ḥadīth traditional studies known as al-Jarḥ wā al-Taʿdīl (the
criticism and declared acceptance of hadith narrators), Riḍā classified their
historical narratives as weak. Jamjamūnī was, on the other hand, of the view
that their status in Islam should be firmly maintained due to their piety, since
any discredit to them would endanger the authenticity of Ḥadīth in general.
In addition to the continuous debate in that year, Riḍā allowed Jamjamūnī
to spell out his views on the issue in details in two serialized articles under the
32
title “Mabḥath fī al-Jarḥ wā al-Taʿdīl.”

Figure 12. Topic 32 (0.08782)

Topic model 32 (0.08782) deals with the visitation and veneration of holy
shrines and tombs which became dominant in 1927-1928 on the basis of
serialized articles containing a debate between the Iraqi Shiʿi scholar Sayyid
Mahdī al-Kāẓimī al-Qazwīnī (1865-1940) and the Sunni salafī Moroccan

scholar Taqī al-Dīn al-Hilālī (1894-1987) about the erecting of shrines and
mosques on the sites of the tombs of family members of the Prophet or pious
venerated figures, where people commemorate or observe prayers besides. In
general, Ridā was a fierce opponent of the visitation of the tombs and the
34
cult of saints in Islam.

Figure 13. Topic 0 (0.08243)

Topic model 0 (0.08243): In 1926- 1927, where the spike is highest,
the topic focuses on the religious ritual question of shortening the daily
obligatory prayers and the exemption of fasting the month of Ramadan
during travel. Riḍā started publishing a series of elven articles containing a
treatise by the well-known medieval Muslim scholar Aḥmad Ibn Taymiyya
(1263-1328) under the title: “Qāʿida jalīla fīmā yatʿlaq bi-aḥkām al-safar
wa-l-iqāma (A Gloriuos base in what is related to the rulings of travel
35
and dwelling),” which is the second volume of the author’s famous work
Majmūʿat al-Rasāʾil wa-l-masāʿil which Riḍā edited and published in his
36
Manār Press in five volumes.

Figure 14. Topic 14 (0.11272)

This topic 14 (0.11272) focuses on the question of unbelief (shirk and kufr)
and faith in general. This topic is dominant in the corpus, but the spike
jumps higher in 1924. We assume that it is connected to Riḍā’s debating,
among others, about the question of mixed marriage between Muslims and
37
non-Muslims, and the above discussions about the Shīʿī veneration of saints,
as well as the critical views by Ibn Taymiyya about the Sufi’s and their
religious practices and behaviour.

Figure 15. Topic 42 (0.11586)

Topic model 42 (0.11586) contains such keywords as “heart”, “self/soul”,
“love”, “creation”, “status/ rank”, “causes”, “truth”, and “unity,” which all
have spiritual-psychological as well as physical meanings. We observe that
the spike gets higher roughly in the years between 1913-1916. Studying the
articles in al-Manār closely, we can conclude that many of these combined
terms are broadly used in two serialized sets of articles: 1) the abovementioned article series, Durūs fī sunan al-kāʾināt, by the Egyptian medical
doctor Muḥammad Tawfīq Ṣidqī, and 2) serialized articles containing extracts
from the well-known classical work Madārij al-Sālikīn (Ranks of the Divine
Seekers) by the medieval Damascene religious scholar Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya
(d. 751/1350). Ṣidqī focuses on biological issues related to the body,
heartbeats and blood circulation. Madārij al-Sālikīn, on the other hand,
contains as a critical commentary on an earlier Sufi classic by the spiritual
master and scholar Abū Ismāʿīl ʿAbdullāh al-Anṣārī of Herat (1006–1088).
Madārij al-Sālikīn aims to revitalize spiritual Qur’anic foundations from a
Sufi point of view by means of a hundred stations that could help the aspiring
38
seeker on the path to God. Few examples of these spiritual stations include
“fear,” “repentance,” “sincerity”, “purification”, “trust,” “submission”,
“gratitude,” “will”, “certainty”, “knowledge,” “wisdom”, “purity”, “life”, and
“love”, which come close to the core meaning of the topic model.

Figure 15. Topic 13 (0.08756)

Topic model 13 (0.08756) combines keywords that are related to the
cosmos and nature including sun, sky, moon, mountains, clouds, universe,
planets as well as the Prophet’s miʿrāj (Ascension to Heavens). We see that
the subject is dominant throughout the corpus with the spike getting higher
roughly during 1908-1911, 1931 and 1935. By 1908 Ṣidqī had published four
serialized articles under the title “al-Qurʾān wā al-ʿIlm (Qur’an and Science)”
in which he tried to interpret the Qur’an from the perspective of language,
history, geography and medicine, and also to answer what he saw “allegations”
of Europeans against the Qur’an and some of its verses related to nature and
39
cosmos. In 1931-1935, we can observe these keywords in various contexts.
For example, in the summer of 1930 a huge debate was triggered by the
publication of the materialist glossed exegesis of the Qur’an by the Azhari
Sheikh Muḥammad Abū Zayd, a former student of Riḍa, under the title AlHidāya wā al-ʿIrfān fī Tafsīr al-Qurʾān bil-Qurʿān (Guidance and Abundant
40
Knowledge in the Exegesis of the Qur’an by means of the Qur’an), in which
Abū Zayd strongly maintained that the cosmic and natural laws are fixed, a
view by which he would reject the miracles mentioned in the Qur’an. In three
serialised articles Riḍā vehemently attacked Abū Zayd as an “atheist” and a
“neo-Bāṭinī,” polemically belittling him for using excessive esoteric (bāṭin)

39 Muḥammad Tawfīq Ṣidqī, “al-Qurʾān wā al-ʿIlm,” al-Manār, 11/3 (May, 1908), 208f, 11/4 (May 1908), 281f , 11/5 (June 1908), 361f; 11/6

interpretation of the Qur’an. 1932 Riḍā had another fierce controversy with
the anti-Wahhābi Azharī Sheikh Yusūf al-Dijwī (d. 1946) regarding many
religious issues, including Riḍā’s critical approach to the ḥadith [narrated by
al-Bukhārī (3199), and Muslim (250)] maintaining that before sunset the
sun “prostrates beneath the Throne of God” and waits for permission to
come back again to rise the next day. Riḍā was of the view that this ḥadīth
was not in common sense with the scientific fact that the sun rotates on
its own self; and that this hadith has been also critically studied by many
Muslim traditionists, such Ibn Ḥajar al-ʿAsqalānī (1371-1449) and Ibn Ḥajar
42
al-Haytamī (1503-1566).

Conclusion
Al-Manār’s topics were automatically generated based on patterns of word
(co-)occurrence, accompanied by a close interpretation of the model results.
Our experimentation with topic modeling on al-Manār, a well-defined
corpus with abundant historical background details available in secondary
sources, focused on studying fluctuating topics over time, particularly those
experiencing higher prominence during specific periods. We examined
keywords not solely as isolated words but as broader religious and political
topics, revealing clear thematic debates within the world of al-Manār. The
experiment yielded historical patterns that aligned with digital results,
providing robust observations of various religious, political, and intellectual
concerns within Muslim reform during Riḍā’s life.
Notably, high spikes in topic prominence demonstrated a temporal
dimension in the corpus, indicating alignment with specific periods and
increased interest in the discussed issues. Given our reliance on prior
knowledge of al-Manār as a homogeneous corpus, the unique results of the
study are closely tied to the quantitative computational method, rather than
presenting surprising factual reconstructions of Riḍā and his worldviews.
While the distant reading approach confirmed known topics, it also
uncovered new subjects that merit further research, such as Riḍā’s debates
with al-Jamjamūnī on Ḥadīth and Abū Zayd on his Qur’anic exegesis.
The study affirmed that, when used correctly and in conjunction with closer
reading, topic modeling can serve as a valuable tool for researching the history
and contents of the Arabic press. This method allows for the exploration of
a broader range of corpora from other Arabic newspapers and magazines,
which should undergo preprocessing for distant digital research and
automated content analysis before undergoing in-depth close reading.
