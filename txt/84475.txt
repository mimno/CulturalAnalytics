This paper presents a quantitative analysis of the representation and affective
encoding of fictional space in a corpus of 125 Swiss literary prose texts of the
19th and early 20th Century written in German, offering a contribution to
both spatial and affective literary studies.
Motivated by questions about the iconic dichotomy between ‘urban’ and ‘rural/
natural’ space in literary works (Sengle; Fournier; Nell and Weiland) – and in
Swiss literature around 1900 in particular (Rehm) – we use computational
methods to detect and examine how different types of space are distributed and
affectively encoded in German-Swiss literature. Taking into account the
complexity of cultural perceptions and representations of space across history,
we examine the presence of ‘urban’ and ‘rural/natural’ fictional spaces and their
potential role in constructing a ‘Swiss’ national literature (Böhler; Zimmer), and
their affective encoding.
In order to do this, we first compiled a comprehensive dictionary of named and
non-named spatial entities in the broad spatial categories RURAL and
URBAN, and examined the presence of sentiment and emotions (valence and
discrete emotions) and their ‘strength’ (arousal) in relation to these. We used
current state-of-the-art sentiment lexicons for German available to the digital
humanities community. Similarly to Heuser et al., we mapped the spatial
entities and the sentiment lexicons onto our corpus, and focused on spans of
+/-50 words around the detected entities, in order to examine the specific
sentiment and emotions related to space.
In an exploratory analysis, we offer here a first-time data-driven perspective on
rural and urban fictional space, incorporating the dimension of affective
encoding of space systematically.

Introduction

1

The representation of fictional space has received increased academic
attention over the last decades, especially in light of the so called ‘spatial
turn’ in the humanities. Franco Moretti is generally regarded as the scholar
who marked the beginning of a new era in literary geography, with maps
being used as tools to examine and interpret literary texts and their cultural

significance (Moretti, Atlas of the European Novel: 1800-1900). His approach,
as that of most of the numerous scholars following his lead (Piatti, Bär,
Reuschel, and Hurni; Heuser et al.; Cooper et al.; Taylor et al.; Evans and
Wilkens, to name only a few), focuses however mainly on geographical and
topographical representations, looking at where and when certain literatures
developed, how these are connected, and how these are temporally
characterised – culturally and linguistically (Moretti, Graphs, Maps, Trees:
Abstract Models for Literary History). Even when stretching the boundaries
of geography to include non-specified locations (see Piatti, Bär, Reuschel,
Hurni, et al.), the main attempt of these explorations has appeared to
produce visualisations of such patterns and spaces, either by applying and
overlapping them onto real world maps, or by showing the relations and
interrelations between objects (such as novels, spatial objects, or characters)
typically using network visualisations (see for example Bushell).
Far less attention has been dedicated to those elements of space representation
that are not geolocations, and that therefore cannot be located on a map. It
this kind of spatial terms that often effectively create the so called ‘storyworld’
(Tally): whether a story is set in a pirate vessel or on a remote island – and
whether or not these may also be locatable somewhere in the real world – the
spatial imagery will often be evoked by simple spatial terms such as ‘deck’ and
‘bridge’, ‘beach’ and ‘cave’, and the objects and architectural parts that make
them ‘tangible’.
We aim here to fill this gap, looking at geographic, named entities (sometimes
referred to as ‘landforms’) as well as at non-named ones, i.e. terms such
as ‘mountain’ or ‘alley’, which we will call ‘spatial terms’ – thus analysing
the representation of space in our corpus both on a geographical level
and on the level of the storyworld. We approach space cultural-semiotically
as ‘landscape,’ i.e. as an ‘area, as perceived by people, whose character is
the result of the action and interaction of natural and/or human factors’
(Council of Europe 2). Considering the idealization, or even mythification,
of rural and natural landscapes – especially the Alps – and the role these have
played for a Swiss national literature (Gsteiger), we hypothesise for our corpus
(1843-1940) that fictionally represented natural and rural space are (a) more
prevalent than urban space and (b) likely to show a more positive and also a
emotionally ‘richer’ encoding than urban space.
The present study focuses on space and affect in German-Swiss fictional
prose written between 1843 and 1940 – a historical period during which the
difference between urban and rural landscape in the European and Germanspeaking literary system robustly emerged (Rehm) – providing a data-driven
approach to observe how space is encoded affectively.
Given the complex nature of the cultural and social construction of
landscape, however, we are also keen to observe whether specific perspectives
would contribute to contrasting results. In particular (1) realist perspectives

that describe rural landscapes in critical/ambivalent ways (Hawkins;
Cosgrove), including incarnations of the popular genre of ‘Dorfgeschichte’
(village tale), and (2) a potential role of the ‘sublime’ in alpine contexts,
which incorporates strong negative emotions alongside strong positive ones
(Denning; Scaramellini; Donaldson et al.).

Natural/Rural landscape as space of yearning and identification?
In the 19th Century, the rapid industrialization across and beyond Europe
intensified rural-urban migration. While in other European literatures the
modern big city emerged with tales of Paris and London, in Switzerland big
city development and corresponding literary accounts lag behind by decades.
In German-speaking Switzerland, not only Rousseau's dictum that only the
natural is wholesome, while man-made things are degenerate (Rousseau 1)
but also the works by von Muralt and others preceded a literary mass
production evoking rural Sehnsuchtsorte (‘places of yearning’) (Piatti and
Streifeneder). This construction, initiated by Albrecht von Haller's The Alps
(Haller), Salomon Geßner's Idylls (Geßner), but also Schiller's Wilhelm Tell
(Schiller), provided an extremely successful version of the active myth
revolving around an alliance between the ‘original’ Swiss people and the
alpine landscape. An exemplary case for landscape-anchored narratives of
what it meant to be ‘Swiss’ (Rusterholz and Solbach) is represented by Heidi
(Spyri), where the natural beauty of the mountains is put in direct contrast
to the city, a place of confinement and restrictions.
In our corpus, however, ‘rural’ literary genres such as Bauern-, Dorf-, and
Bergroman (respectively farmer, village and mountain novels) cover a
relatively variable spectrum of aesthetic, poetic, and ideological positions.
Many farmers’ and village stories belong in a socially-conscious realistic
tradition led by Jeremias Gotthelf and Gottfried Keller, in which both rural
and urban landscapes are depicted in an ambivalent, ironic, and partially
critical way. Through literary history, alpine spaces have been depicted on a
spectrum across the ‘horrible’ (locus horribilis), ‘sublime’, ‘picturesque’, all
the way to the cliché (Lafond-Kettlitz). The dichotomous schema ‘urban/
rural’ in Swiss narratives of the 19th/early 20th Century appears thus both
obvious and problematic. What is more, Swiss prose fiction of this period
does not represent exclusively ‘Swiss’ settings, but portrays other existing and
2
imaginary countries, as well as very different social contexts, focusing on the
one hand on the Volk (people), Älpler (‘people of the Alps’) and Bauern
(‘farmers’), and on the other hand on the (Bildungs-)Bürger, the bohème, and
3
the nobility.

2 We include geographical locations of countries surrounding Switzerland (the current territories of Italy, France, Austria and Germany). This

allows gauging how ‘spatially self-referential’ the texts in our corpus are.
3 A typical German-Swiss type of the village story is the double encoding for popular and bourgeois audiences, see Tschopp.

Taking into account these characteristics, we investigate here how
prominently the ‘rural/natural’ is featured in contrast to the ‘urban’, and how
each is affectively encoded. To this end, we present our approach as proof
of concept, putting to use existing digital resources in German. The corpus
used for our analysis was created by gathering digitised texts, and we aimed
at providing a collection of German-Swiss works as diverse as possible with
respect to the literary forms described above, their narrative structures and
their audiences. It comprises low-brow as well as high-brow literary texts
(as well as texts that sit between these extremes), and displays a wide array
of spatial settings such as cities, towns, villages, and natural-secluded areas.
This collection thus allows for an assessment of the distribution of types of
spatial terms and their respective affective encoding. Further philological and
historical research will thereby be enabled.

Affect and fictional texts
The emotions and sentiment related to fictional space constitute a longstanding interest of literary and cultural studies (Lehnert; Schumacher).
The affective turn in literary studies in the 1990s put a spotlight on the
close relationship between sentiment, emotions and fictional texts, as these
have long been means of exploring subjective, yet shared, human expression
and representation of emotions. Both the textual craft of emotion and the
corresponding empathy evoked in readers (Oatley and P. N. Johnson-Laird;
Hogan) have received scholarly attention, and current cognitive psychology
suggests that almost anything deriving from human consciousness is in some
way emotionally grounded (Russell, “Emotion, Core Affect, and
Psychological Construction”).
The investigation of affect in relation to fictional texts can refer to the
emotions and sentiments perceived in the reader (Jacobs et al.; Menninghaus
et al.; Schindler et al.), but also to the portrayal of emotion and sentiment
in the text and the symbolically encoded fictional world (Hillebrandt; Winko).
This latter approach, which we pursue in the current study, does not
investigate how a reader would respond, but focuses on the ‘emotion
potential’ encoded in the text (Herrmann and Lüdtke).
Text-based approaches typically classify texts based on the presence of
unambiguous ‘affect words’, i.e. words that can be associated to a positive/
negative value (called valence or polarity) and or to a specific discrete emotion
(joy, sadness etc.). While this approach is relatively simple and does not
require enormous computational power, it must be considered that its results
largely depend on the resources used to determine the valence and/or the
emotions associated with words – in digital humanities, the current standard
is the so called ‘sentiment lexicons’.

Examining the representation of landscape and its emotional value in German-Swiss fiction between 1840 and 1940

In the following sections, we will introduce how we applied computational
text-based sentiment analysis methodology to explore the emotional and
affective encoding of different types of fictional space, comparing the
performance of the existing sentiment lexicons for German.

Computational sentiment and emotion analysis
Sentiment analysis (SA) and emotion detection have become an approachable
methodology not only for scholars with a background in information
technology and natural language processing (Pang and Lee), but also for
those in the humanities (Y.-S. G. Kim et al.; Eder et al.; Scherer; Schindler
et al.). A growing body of SA studies has determined sentiment scores for
whole literary texts or computed affective variation throughout a narrative
(E. Kim et al.; Reagan et al.; Jacobs; Mohammad, Sentiment Analysis of
Mail and Books; Klinger et al.; Zehe et al.). Under investigation ar different
types of texts (Kakkonen and Kakkonen; Jockers and Underwood) and genres
such as fairy tales (Alm and Sproat; Mohammad, “From Once upon a
Time to Happily Ever after: Tracking Emotions in Mail and Books”), and
historic plays (Mohammad, “From Once upon a Time to Happily Ever after:
Tracking Emotions in Mail and Books”; Schmidt et al.). Results are however
often not suited for generalisations: on the one hand, because of the lack
of standard procedures recognised by the academic community, and on the
other, because of the idiosyncratic characteristics of corpora representing
particular literary domains, as well as because of the specificity of sentiment
and emotions lexicons, often built to address specific research questions.
As for many other complex phenomena, literary studies have imported
theories of emotions and sentiment from other disciplines, in particular
cognitive psychology, evolutionary biology and philosophy. These differ in
their conceptualisation of such phenomena as well as in their application
of these, and it is therefore not surprising that several different concepts of
sentiments and emotion are used in literary studies.
We conceptualise here textual sentiment as the underlying feeling, attitude
or evaluation associated with a proposition that can be analysed in terms of
valence and arousal (Liu). The term valence reflects the sentiment orientation,
or polarity, ranging from pleasant to neutral to unpleasant. One can think
of it as an indication of ‘positivity,’ i.e. whether the general sentiment of
the text is negative, neutral or positive. Sentiment can also be evaluated
in terms of arousal, which is defined as the degree to which a particular
stimulus ‘activates’ the experiencer for action (Russell, “A Circumplex Model
of Affect.”). Arousal ranges from high (or active) to low (or passive), and
can be substantially understood as the level of intensity of the sentiment
expressed.

The concept of emotion is somewhat more complex, and it has been object
of numerous debates, especially with regards of what is perceived and defined
as ‘emotion’ and what can be empirically observed (Scherer). While the open
questions on this topic are certainly worth further research, we will treat
‘emotions’ here as understood by Ortony and Turner and Clore and Ortony,
i.e. as ‘affective reactions made specific by the different social and
psychological situations in which they arise. […] their identity depends on the
context. As a result, emotions can be as varied in nature and number as the
situations they represent […] Emotions, then, are simply affective states that
are about something. (Fox et al.)’
According to several psychological models of emotions, humans are thought
to have a set of so-called ‘basic emotions,’ particular affective states that are
assumed to be cross-culturally recognizable. Basic emotions are described as
‘discrete’ because they are believed to be idiosyncratic and distinguishable
by an individual’s facial expression and/or biological processes. Such ‘basic’
emotions can combine to form more complex ones to cover the whole
emotional spectrum. Some of the existing theoretical models for basic
emotions are summarised in Table 1 below:

Sentiment and emotion lexicons
As readers, it is generally possible to intuitively understand the sentiment and
the emotions conveyed by a text, thanks to linguistic devices as well as to
co-textual and contextual information, including individual or shared sociocultural experiences.
What we are interested in examining in this paper is how these values are
encoded in the text, rather than how readers respond to them. In order to
express emotions and sentiment in writing, several linguistic strategies can

be used, such as grammatical and lexical expressions, intensifiers, superlatives,
or special punctuation (Mohammad, “Imagisaurus: An Interactive Visualizer
of Valence and Emotion in the Roget’s Thesaurus”). The sentiment analysis
approach used in the present paper focuses on the detection of so-called
emotion or mood words, i.e. words that are understood as possessing an
emotional and/or sentiment value. This approach makes use of a definite
list of words – ideally compiled by means of a theory-driven and controlled
procedure – associated with one or more values, which typically reflect
whether a word embeds sentiment and/or emotions, and how intensely.
Within literary studies, the theoretical frameworks most commonly used for
the investigation of sentiment and emotions are respectively Russell’s twodimensional sentiment model (“A circumplex model of affect”) – with valence
as the degree of positivity and negativity expressed, and arousal representing
the strength of the sentiment expressed – and Ekman et al.'s atlas of emotions
(Ekman et al.) – featuring six basic emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness,
surprise. These word lists can be then mapped onto a corpus, providing a
measure of sentiment and emotions. This approach is generally referred to as
lexicon-based, and it is one of three broad classes of computational tools used
for sentiment analysis across disciplines, which can be distinguished according
to whether they use word lists (e.g., Jockers), vector-space models (e.g.,
Turney and Littman), or a combination of both (for reviews see Taboada et
al.; Jacobs and Kinder). In line with other scholars (Jacobs et al.), we rely here
on the lexical coverage of lexicons – i.e. the percentage of words of a given
text or corpus covered by a given sentiment lexicon – to establish the validity
4
of our results.
Some limitations have to be kept in mind when working with lexiconbased approaches: the finite amount of words in the lexicons (on which the
coverage often depends); the differences between one lexicon and another;
and the sometime lack of transparency in the way the lexicons were
developed. Moreover, sentiment lexicons are built on contemporary language
usage, and might not be comprehensive of historical forms or archaic
meanings of words that are pertinent to a specific historical corpus such as
the one we are examining here. The two alternative approaches – creating
(and validating) a custom sentiment lexicon, or using machine learning –
are however extremely resource and time intensive. Since tests in the current
historical project showed a word coverage comparable to contemporary
5
language, we decided to utilise out-of-the box resources. Lexicon-based
approaches remain among the most easily accessible and practicable methods

4 In general terms, it is assumed that a low coverage decreases the validity of a sentiment lexicon. Some scholars from experimental psychology

have even suggested that a coverage below 50% cannot be considered reliable (Jacobs et al.).
5 Elsewhere, with a different aim, we report on ongoing domain adaptation of sentiment analysis using machine learning (Grisot et al.).

for sentiment analysis (Jockers and Thalken; Flüh), and as these represent the
essential building ground for more complex unsupervised sentiment models
(Nakov et al.; Barbieri et al.), it is crucial to keep using and improving them.
The application and further development of sentiment analysis techniques
has been impacted by industrial interest in customer research, with most
of the research done on the English language. Not as much attention has
been given to the investigation of literary and other creative texts, and up
to now only few resources are available for languages other than English.
Nonetheless, in recent years, with the expansion of the digital humanities,
new research has resulted in valuable lexicons also for other languages,
including German.
We chose to examine emotions and sentiments in our corpus using all the
open source lexicons for German available to this date, as suggested by
recent research in the field (Kern et al.; Schmidt, Dangel, et al.). We hope
therewith to provide a ground for gauging not only how these lexicons
compare to each other, but, most crucially, how valid they are for analysing
the representation of emotions in relation to space in historical German-Swiss
fiction (~1840-1940).
It is not the scope of the present paper to provide a comprehensive
comparison of the existing sentiment lexicons for German, nor to evaluate
in depth their coverage of the historical dimension of affective language.
However, some of their characteristics – in particular regarding the number
of words included in the lexicons and their coverage of our corpus – do
help us evaluating the potential differences in their performance. A minimal
summary of the lexicons used and their composition is shown in Table 2.

Method
Objectives
From the prominent role of a Swiss-national framework that marked literary
production during our time frame, and that putatively sees an opposition
between rural/natural and urban spaces, we formulate here two main
hypotheses: (1) natural and rural landscapes will be overall more present in
our corpus in comparison to towns and cities, and (2), natural and rural
landscapes will be encoded overall as more ‘positive.’ Aware that realist
writing does depict problematic aspects of life in rural surroundings,
however, we retain that the difference in emotional encoding between urban
and rural spaces may not be as neat as we hypothesise.
Our exploration will start with (1) a description of the distribution of
different types of spatial entities detected in our corpus, and move on to (2)
investigating their affective encoding. Importantly, this extends to questions
about how ‘spatially self-referential’ the texts in our corpus are, comparing
the proportion of mentions of Swiss geographical locations with those of
countries surrounding Switzerland (the current territories of Italy, France,
Austria and Germany).
We are not aware of any research investigating the presence and distribution
of non-named spatial entities along with geolocations in fictional texts, nor
systematically comparing rural and urban environments (real or fictional)
in terms of the sentiments and emotions related to these. It is this gap
that the present paper addresses. Using on the one hand lists of spatial
entities that can be matched to our historical literary corpus, and on the
other sentiment lexicons that capture the sentiment and emotional value of
words, we examine here how the rural and natural landscape and geographical
locations are represented, in opposition to urban space and settlements.

Corpus
The compilation of a corpus of Swiss fictional narratives written between
the years 1843 and 1940 presented several challenges, in particular due to
the lack of a comprehensive catalogue of Swiss fictional works for those
years, and to the limited amount of works already existing in a digital
form. With the collaboration of experts from the University Library Basel, a
comprehensive list of the authors and works of interest to our project was
6
produced, featuring more than 7,000 titles of fictional narratives written by
7
Swiss authors in German between the years 1880 and 1930.

6 See details in Herrmann et al.
7 Authors born elsewhere who completed their education in Switzerland were also included, considering that a sufficiently long period of time

for them to have been influenced by its culture and become aware of its geography.

Examining the representation of landscape and its emotional value in German-Swiss fiction between 1840 and 1940

Using the list of authors and titles obtained, we aimed to gather as many of
the listed works as possible in their digital version. A corpus of 125 Swiss
texts was thus compiled, combining 79 texts which already existed in digital
form and matched our list of Swiss fiction texts – from Gutenberg.de (Projekt
Gutenberg DE) – with 46 additional texts, which were newly digitised by
the University Library Basel as part of the research project ‘High Mountains
Low Arousal? Distant Reading Topographies of Sentiment in German Swiss
Novels in the early 20th Century’ as a contribution to the European Literary
Text Collection (ELTeC) (Schöch et al.). The corpus contains narrative texts
by 42 different authors, with a maximum of n=14 works attributed to a single
author (Heinrich Federer) and a minimum of n=1 (several authors). More
8
details about the final corpus are available on our online repository.
All of the texts were stored as plain text files, and were then processed with
the German language model of the R package ‘Udpipe’ (R Core Team;
Wijffels), to tokenise and lemmatise the texts while preserving information
about paragraphing and sentence structure.

Spatial entities
In terms of the operationalisation of literary landscape, our categorisation of
spatial entities overlaps in part with what Wartmann et al. (1580) identify
as biophysical landscape elements – i.e. ‘terms relating to geology, landforms,
soil, land cover, flora, fauna, and climate,’ as distinct from cultural landscape
elements – ‘terms referring to land use, settlements, infrastructure,
9
domesticated animals, and anthropogenic objects.’ Central to this definition
is the notion of landscape as being something which is perceived and defined
by the ways in which it is described by people (Scott, “Assessing Public
Perception of Landscape: The LANDMAP Experience”; Scott, “Assessing
Public Perception of Landscape: From Practice to Policy”).
We found however that this taxonomy only takes into account the distinction
between ‘natural’ and ‘human-made,’ but not that between ‘rural’ and
‘urban.’ Because both ‘rural’ and ‘urban’ are related to human practices, we
decided to use a broader umbrella notion of RURAL for all terms related to
‘nature’ and proper names of natural places, as well as terms referring to rural
landscapes and proper names of rural settlements. Analogously, URBAN is

9 We use the term ‘landscape’ as defined by the European Landscape Convention (Council of Europe), namely as ‘an area, as perceived by

people, whose character is the result of the action and interaction of natural and/or human factors.’

our umbrella term for both proper names of larger settlements – cities and
towns – and for terms describing – or characteristic of – the urban landscape
10
as generally conceived in the European culture.
In order to further differentiate RURAL and URBAN space we identified
four ‘entity’ subcategories for the broad category RURAL, namely ‘rural’ and
‘natural’ terms, ‘rural geolocations,’ and ‘natural geolocations;’ as well as two
entities subcategories for URBAN: ‘urban geolocations’ and ‘urban’ terms.
We collected as many terms as we could for each subcategory, including,
where possible, terms that are characteristic of Swiss landscapes/architecture,
such as Hütte or Dörfli. The six categories are described in Table 3 below:
Table 3. Six entities categories identified under the umbrella terms RURAL and URBAN.
RURAL

URBAN

‘rural entities’
entities’: spatial terms relating to – or characteristic of –
the countryside, in particular related to human settlements or
infrastructures, as opposed to those of the city (for example
Wanderweg: footpath, Feld: field, Hütte: hut, shack)

‘urban entities’
entities’: spatial terms relating to
the city, its buildings and infrastructures
(for example Bahnhof: station, Kreuzung:
cross, Palast: palace)

‘natural entities’
entities’: terms describing spatial elements as found in
nature, not involving anything made or done by people (for
example Berg: mountain, Bach: brook, Wald: forest)

‘geolocation-urban entities’ (geoloc_urb)
(geoloc_urb):
proper names of cities and towns in
Switzerland, Austria, Germany, France
and Italy (for example Berlin, Paris, Rom)

‘geolocation-natural (geoloc_nat) entities’
entities’: proper names of
natural locations such as mountains, rivers, valley, lakes (for
example Matterhorn, Mont Blanc, Donau)
‘geolocation-rural (geoloc_rur) entities’
entities’: proper names of villages
and small towns – with less than 5,000 inhabitants – in
Switzerland, Austria, Germany, France and Italy (for example
Zumdorf, Enggwil, Huttwil)

Because of the morphology of the German language with its abundance
of compound words, the identification of verbs, adverbs and adjectives
potentially belonging to the spatial categories revealed complex and often
ambiguous ( e.g., directional adverbs such as talabwärts, bergabwärts: ‘down
the valley,’ ‘downhill,’ or berghoch: 'as tall as a mountain / ‘uphill;’ all
containing ‘Tal’ – valley – and ‘Berg’ – mountain). It was therefore decided
to focus on substantives only.
Rural, urban and natural terms were initially collected from
openthesaurus.de (Naber), Wikidata (Wiki), and Swiss Idiotikon (Hunger et
al.). These lists were then enriched with the natural terms gathered in the
Text+Berg project Bubenhofer et al. as presented by Derungs and Purves
and with the urban terms collected by Bologna, translated into German. The
lists were then manually checked and improved with the help of a student
assistant (L1 German and Swiss German), who removed redundancies and

10 While designations vary in different countries and regions, the International Statistics Conference of 1887 defined different sizes of German

cities based on their population size, as follows: Landstadt (‘country town’; under 5,000), Kleinstadt (‘small town’; 5,000 to 20,000),
Mittelstadt (‘middle-sized town’; between 20,000 and 100,000) and Großstadt (‘large town’; 100,000 or more) (Baumgart et al.). We apply
this taxonomy to our geographical locations independently of the country, considering all settlements with a population smaller than 5,000
as villages – thus belonging to the RURAL entity-group – and all settlements with a population above 5,000 as cities.

cross-category terms. While we discarded texts fully written in German-Swiss
dialect from the corpus because of problems with language processing –
especially in tokenization and sentiment analysis – some relevant dialectal
words (e.g. Hütte, Dörfli) and as many Swiss-specific terms as possible were
added for each list.
For geoloc_urb, geoloc_rur and geoloc_nat locations of today’s territories of
Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Italy and France, open data available from
geonames.org (Wick and Boutreux) and Wikidata (Wiki) were used. We
decided to include geographical locations of countries surrounding
Switzerland as these are likely to play a part in the representation of the
RURAL and URBAN landscape in German-Swiss literature in the historical
time frame considered. These sources allowed us to store also more specific
information, in particular about the category geoloc_nat, enabling us to
distinguish whether these were streams or lakes, valleys, mountains or forests.
After a process of selection, removal of duplicates, hyphenated location
names, cross-category terms (for example Kirche – ‘church’) and names of
places that correspond to common nouns (for example Zug, which also
11
denotes ‘train’) or proper names, we obtained a final list of N=173,913
spatial entities belonging to the five subcategories of RURAL and URBAN.
Details of these are summarised in Table 4.

Sentiment and discrete emotions
After removing German stopwords, symbols and punctuation, we matched
our lists of spatial entities onto the corpus. We created therewith a new
corpus composed by the spans defined by the matched spatial terms, where
each span comprised 101 words: one matched entity, the 50 words preceding
it and the 50 words following it. The resulting corpus counted N=6,776,378

11 A list of German first names was obtained from the open archive of the city of Cologne https://offenedaten-koeln.de/dataset/vornamen.

tokens. We then merged each sentiment lexicon onto our corpus by lower
case lemmas – having also lemmatised each token – and calculated aggregated
values for all the sentiment/emotions for each of text span defined by the
presence of a spatial entity. Sentiment and emotion values were aggregated
by span. For lexicons measuring discrete emotions, we gave a score of 1
to each word in the span with an emotion value, and counted the sum
per emotion, per span, thus obtaining counts for each discrete emotion.
Also for lexicons measuring sentiment (arousal, valence) we aggregated the
values by span: where values were continuously scaled, we calculated the
mean values for arousal and valence. Since mixed models for lexicons were
computed independently, we did not need to normalise values across lexicons.
If the valence value was categorical (negative vs. positive), we converted these
respectively into -1 and 1 and calculated the mean value by span.
As each span was defined by the presence of a single entity, we were able to
label each span as either RURAL or URBAN. This allowed us to examine
the corpus as a whole, analysing statistically the two broad spatial categories
RURAL and URBAN for differences between encoded emotions and
sentiment values.
To establish beforehand whether the entities in our lists possessed themselves
an emotional value (as this could affect the values for sentiment and emotions
of the spans) we found that spatial terms covered together only the 1.1%
of the entities. This shows on the one hand that the sentiment lexicons
used contain very few locations or spatial terms, and on the other hand
that the entities themselves – necessarily present in each text span in our
corpus – would be unlikely to bias the sentiment and emotion value of the
surrounding text.

Statistical analyses
For our statistical analyses, we used linear mixed-effect models (Kuznetsova et
al.; Bates et al.; Baayen), with the broader space type (URBAN/RURAL) as
fixed factor, and the author and title of each of the spans as random factors.
We ran mixed models for each lexicon independently.
For spatial entities we report descriptive statistics in terms of raw and relative
frequencies.

RURAL and URBAN. We observe a pronounced skewness for our entities
list, where combined RURAL entities amount to 96.7% in total, a number
that largely surpasses that of URBAN ones (3.3% in total).
Here, it is important to note the categorical difference between the two bar
charts: In the left bar chart, we see the entity list, which was compiled from
multiple resources. It is a proxy for the distribution of factual geographical
locations in Switzerland, France, Germany, Italy and Austria: Here, the total
number of villages, mountains, rivers, lakes and valleys – i.e. geoloc_rur and
geoloc_nat entities – greatly surpasses the number of large towns and cities
(geoloc_urb). In this bar chart, the number of named-entity terms is also by
far higher than the number of rural, urban and natural non-named entity
terms terms.
By contrast, the bar chart on the right shows the text corpus. Searching for
the list’s terms in the N=125 Swiss literary texts (N=3,539,090 tokens), we
find a total of N=67,093 (meaning that 1.9% of all tokens in our corpus are
either RURAL or URBAN spatial entities).
Here, the difference between the macro categories URBAN (green) and
RURAL (blue) is much less pronounced, but still remarkable: around three
quarters of all detected spatial entities fall into the RURAL umbrella category
(73%, vs. 27% URBAN).
Details of the distribution of entities in the Swiss corpus can be observed
in Table 5 (for ease of comparison, the distribution of the entities list (left
column) is repeated from Table 4).

In the corpus, the overall prevalence of RURAL entities (n=48,950) in
comparison to URBAN ones (n=18,143) is particularly due to natural terms,
the biggest category overall, with 36.5% of all spatial entities detected
(n=24,500 tokens). It is followed by the urban category, with n=11,889
tokens, and the geoloc_rur (n=11,864 tokens) category, which each contribute
about half the proportion of natural.
Relative to the number of terms in the entities lists, we note the highest
coverage for non-named entities (natural, urban and rural). By coverage
we understand the percentage of unique terms (corpus-linguistic types) per
category actually found as tokens in the corpus).
This can be explained by the relatively small number of terms included in
these three categories, and the fact that we are dealing with common terms,
as opposed to proper names of locations. However, it is notable that the
relatively small categories natural, urban and rural (n=1060 in total in the
entities list) represent about two thirds of all the spatial entities found in the
corpus (n=44,920, 67%).
This is quantitative support for the observation that general and common
terms (our rural, urban and natural categories) are used across narratives
to build the so called ‘storyworld’ (Gavins; Troscianko): creating settings,
landscapes, natural phenomena and objects in the fictional world (Nünning).
Geolocations (geoloc_urb, geoloc_rur and geoloc_nat), on the other hand, while
making up an overpowering proportion in the spatial entities list (see Figure
1), are comparably less frequent in the corpus (33%). Such low frequency can
be explained by their semantic specificity, and by the fact that fictional texts
do not necessarily mention (m)any existing geographical locations. Given the
sheer number of locations listed in our entities list, it is not surprising that
only a small fraction would make it into literary texts, and fewer still into a
relatively small corpus such as the one analysed here.
Nonetheless, when considering the percentages of geolocations (geoloc_rur
17.7%, geoloc_urb 9.3%, geoloc_nat 6%), the dominance of RURAL is again
notable: geoloc_rur and geoloc_nat together amount to 23.7% of all spatial
entities. Together, their substantial proportion (one fourth of all spatial

entities) may be interpreted as reflecting a type of realistic writing that is
anchored not only in (imaginary) references to ‘meadow,’ ‘river,’ ‘hill’, but
which can be mapped onto factual geography.

national self-referentiality: are swiss geolocations
more prominent in the corpus in comparison to other
countries?
With regard to the dimension of national identity construction discussed
above, we still need to answer an open question: do the authors in our corpus
– all Swiss – favour the representation of Swiss geographical locations in
comparison to locations in other countries?
As discussed above, the list of N =173,913 spatial entities compiled for the
present paper was inclusive of six categories: geoloc_nat (natural geolocations),
geoloc_rur (rural geolocations), geoloc_urb (urban geolocations), natural, rural
and urban. In addition to this categorization, we were able to classify
geolocations by country (Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland), and
for the geoloc_nat category distinguish among specific sub-classes, namely
streams, lakes, valleys, mountains or forests.
In view of the aforementioned strengthening of nationalism in Switzerland
during the period 1843-1940, we assumed that it would exhibit more national
12
self-references as opposed to references to other countries. In operational
terms, we expected the corpus to feature, proportionally, more Swiss
geographical locations than non-Swiss locations, and in particular we
hypothesised that rural and natural geolocations would be prominent in
comparison to urban ones, especially when observing Swiss geolocations.
Using identical tools to gather spatial entities and geographical locations for
the five countries considered, the raw account of entities per country in
our entity list broadly mirrors the country size (see upper part of Table 6),
with Germany at the top counting n=74,135 geographical locations, and
13
Switzerland last, counting n=13,784.
At first glance, when focusing on the figures printed in the lower half
Table 6, it appears that our corpus of German-Swiss texts contains more
German geolocations than Swiss ones, across all three categories (geoloc_nat,
geoloc_rur, geoloc_urb). This is in fact true in raw counts, and may be taken as
support for the basic tenet that German-written literature is a transnational
literature, transcending boundaries between the German Empire (as of 1871),
Austria, and Switzerland – a consideration that can be extended to

geolocations of France and Italy, as shown by our data. However, a closer
comparative look at the upper half (list) and the lower half (corpus) of the
table reveals an interesting pattern: in comparison to the proportions of
unique tokens of geographical entities in our list (upper half) we observe
a consistently and significantly higher percentage of Swiss geographical
14
locations in the lower half, while most other percentages drop between the
list and the corpus. This is summarised in Figure 2 below.

Examining the representation of landscape and its emotional value in German-Swiss fiction between 1840 and 1940

Importantly, for all three geolocation categories – geoloc_nat, geoloc_rur and
geoloc_urb – the proportion of Swiss locations features a substantial increase
in the corpus in comparison to the presence of the same entities in
Switzerland’s neighbour countries, with natural geolocations going from 14.9
to 24.4 (+9.5%), rural settlements from 5.4 to 15.1 (+9.7%) and Swiss cities
rising from 5.4 to 24.1 (+18.7%).
While we do not receive support for an extreme national focus we can thus
observe a notable tendency for Swiss self-reference in the corpus, especially
when comparing the proportional numbers for the different entities categories.
This is shown in Table 7 and Figure 3 below, which zoom in on the
geolocations subcategories city, forest, mountain, stream/lake, valley and
village. They show an increase of detected Swiss geographical locations
specifically for ‘valleys’ (+57.6% in comparison to the entity list) and cities
(+18.7%), followed by villages (+9.7%), mountains (+9%) and streams/lakes
(+4.4%). This increase is counterbalanced particularly by a decrease of
references to German and Austrian ‘valleys’ and German cities.
Again, we find a complex transnational picture, with a relative dominance
of German geolocations for all categories, except valleys. However, the
comparison between list and corpus shows a notable difference in the
categories indicative of the idealised Swiss landscape: valleys, villages,
mountains and streams and lakes. In terms of absolute frequencies for the
corpus in general (regardless of national attribution), subcategories show
the following rank order: village (n=11,864), city (n=6,254), mountain
(n=2,762), stream_lake (n=952), forest (n=250) and valley (n=91)).
This rank order mirrors the known setting of the stories in quantitative terms.
The analysis of proportions of the different spatial categories in our corpus
provides insight into the depiction of space and landscape in Swiss fiction
between 1840 and 1940 – a time frame that in German literary history
covers epoch-constructions such as ‘Biedermeier’/restauration, realism, and
modernism. Working towards an Swiss-specific literary historiography, we
observe a a dominance of RURAL space that may be less pronounced in
other German-language literatures, a use of natural and rural geolocations
that may indicate a specific type of realistic anchoring in non-fictional and
often Swiss geography, as well as a dominance of landscape elements that
match ‘idealised Swissness’. Meanwhile, the observed comparatively high
recurrence of non-named spatial terms appears a universal feature of
narratives. In all, these data-based patterns underscore the assumption of a
‘Swiss-specific’ encoding of the rural and natural environment.

Sentiment and Emotions
As mentioned above, for each sentiment and emotion value present in the
sentiment lexicons, we fitted a mixed model which looked at the difference
between spans defined as RURAL or URBAN based on the spatial entities
detected in the corpus. The model had thus RURAL/URBAN as fixed
factor, and included title and author as random effects (formula: ‘value
15
~ type_grouped + (1|author/title)’). All the results of these models are
summarised in Table 8 and 9 below. The columns RURAL and URBAN
summarise the result of each model, with a ‘+’ and a ‘-’ simplifying the
models outcome. When a ‘+’ or a ‘-’ is shown, it indicates that the entity type
RURAL/URBAN had significant effect on the sentiment/emotion value.
A ‘+’ shows an increase for the value considered, while a ‘-’ indicates a
significant decrease. If the cell contains ‘na’, the entity type had no significant
effect on that value.
In line with our expectations, we detected a general increase in the emotional
‘richness’ of spans containing RURAL entities, in comparison to URBAN
ones. Particularly informative are the results obtained with the SentiArt

lexicon, where this was true for all discrete emotions (positive as well as
negative ones). With a lexical coverage of 81.8%, results obtained with the
SentiArt lexicon can be considered as comparatively most reliable.
With the caveat of a low coverage, the Stamm and Klinger et al. lexicons show
significant differences for discrete emotions between RURAL and URBAN
as well: Stamms’ anger, sadness, and fear appear to be significantly more
present in RURAL spans, as well as Klinger et al.'s anger, sadness, fear and
contempt. Only Stamm's anticipation and disgust appeared to be higher in
URBAN spans, while models for all other emotions did not show any effect
of space categories. Because of the low coverage of these lexicons, these results
must be however interpreted with great caution.
When looking at sentiment values, we found again results in line with our
hypothesis. Both BAWL-R and LANG lexicons featured a significantly higher
valence in spans containing RURAL spatial entities, and, more importantly,
the same was true for SentiArt’s AAP value (affective-aesthetic potential),
which strongly correlates with valence (Jacobs and Kinder, “Computing
the Affective-Aesthetic Potential of Literary Texts”). Along with the other
discrete emotions detected by SentiArt, the AAP appeared to be strongly
affected by the entity type, with spans containing RURAL entities featuring
significantly higher AAP than those containing URBAN ones, thus
16
indicating a more ‘positive’ encoding for the first.
In terms of arousal, no difference was found for either the BAWL-R or the
LANG lexicons.

Discussion
Exploring the representation and emotional encoding of space in GermanSwiss literature between 1840 and 1940, we focused on the one hand on the
distribution of specific types of space in our corpus – geographical locations
(named entities) as well as non-named spatial terms – and on the other on the
difference between the two spatial macro categories RURAL and URBAN
with regard to valence/polarity and discrete emotions.
The analysis of proportions of the different types of spatial entities in our
corpus showed a clear dominance of RURAL entities, constituted mostly by
recurrent ‘general’ non-named spatial terms (natural, urban, rural).

16 On the basis of the wide comparison of resources, our analysis detected also some ambiguity with respect to valence, as an increase in this

value was found for spans containing URBAN entities in comparison to those containing RURAL ones for the GerPol, Glex and SentiWS
lexicons. Again, these lexicons have a lower coverage than the SentiArt and BAWL-R lexicons, but all three surpass LANG. While it is not
the scope of the present paper to determine the effectiveness of these tools, a more thorough investigation is needed to understand why these
results are not in agreement.

Examining the representation of landscape and its emotional value in German-Swiss fiction between 1840 and 1940

Overall, about two thirds of all spatial entities detected are ‘non-named’,
while one third of them are in fact geolocations. This number appears
substantial, and supports the assumption of a specific realist mode
dominating Swiss literature throughout a long 19th Century – a mode that
uses extra-fictional references to anchor the story-worlds quite palpably close
to reality . Together with the finding that many of these references are ‘Swiss,’
we take these data-based patterns to underscore the assumption of a ‘Swissspecific’ idealisation of the rural and natural environment. However, in the
absence of more highly or broadly scaled analyses, these interpretations are
necessarily provisional - yet they point to important research questions on the
specificity and factuality of spatial entities, i.e. space representation in fiction
across genres, periods, and (trans-)national literatures.
In terms of fictional reference to factual locations, increased proportions of
Swiss geolocations were found for most subcategories (city, village, mountain,
stream/lake, valley), with the exception of forest – the category with the
overall lowest number of terms and matches. The increase of percentage from
the entity list to our corpus was particularly significant for valleys (57.6%)
and cities (18.7%), somewhat in line with our assumption about the relevance
of the rural/urban dualism in the conceptualisation of landscape. These
findings await further (qualitative) exploration, for example looking into the
role of specific cities/towns or valleys, exploring fictional connections to
the traditional cultural and political predominance of towns in Switzerland.
Much the same holds for ‘valleys’, which may be an often idealised and
fictionalised dwelling place for the characters of the stories, but which in fact
appear only infrequently in our corpus.
All in all, the findings we gathered on a corpus compiled as a proxy for a
representative collection of German-Swiss prose support the view that Swiss
authors in the period were indeed influenced by ideas about national identity,
remarkably setting apart ‘their German literature’ from other national
German literatures. Overall, they tended to make substantial use of realworld locations, thereby referring to their own nation more than to nearby
countries. At the same time, we see a relatively strong role of German
geolocations in our German-Swiss corpus. This finding can be explained by
a strong trans- or pre-national tradition of a literature written in German
(Muschg). Further comparative analyses are clearly pending, asking about
diachronic change, which may potentially be influenced by WWI and WWII,
leading to further increase in own-nation references.
When looking at the emotional representation encoded in our corpus in
relation to spatial entities, the quantitative results supported main
assumptions of literary history: in Swiss literature 1840-1940, rural and
natural landscapes were generally perceived and represented as more positive
and emotionally rich, when considered in opposition to the urban
environment. The stories take predominantly place in villages, rural, and

natural settings. Some of them are located in rather realistic historical
scenarios, going along with a full spectrum of everyday joy and sorrow
(‘authentic stories’); others depict more clearly idealised places of longing,
including idyllic scenarios, tourist-oriented mountaineering adventures, or
openly ideologised conservative ‘Heimatliteratur’ (restaurative and/or
popularly-clichéd literature). The nature settings incorporate an ambivalent
perception of natural landscape, on the one hand potentially encoding the
‘sublime’ – including fearful/negative as well admiring/positive emotions
at the same time – on the other, they can be indicative of the type of
politically engaged story that depicts poverty and rural despair. Meanwhile,
urban settings, which altogether are substantially less often explicitly invoked,
nevertheless are significantly less positive, and are also attributed significantly
fewer different discrete emotions. Life is less joyful here, and there seems to
be less life altogether, if ‘life’ is to be measured in presence and variance of
discrete emotions.

Conclusions
The present study set as its goal a proof-of-concept exploration of landscape
representation in German-Swiss literary prose, using computational resources
and methods that are both openly accessible and popular within DH literary
studies to analyse sentiment and emotion related to these (elsewhere, with a
different aim, we report on ongoing domain adaptation of sentiment analysis
using machine learning (Grisot et al.).
Our results detected significant differences in the affective encoding of rural
and urban spatial entities, with rural/natural space being overall depicted
as possessing a richer array of discrete emotions, and, crucially, as being
represented overall more positively. Questions might raise from the fact that
the richer array of emotions includes ‘positive’ as well as ‘negative’ ones. It
is to be considered, therefore, that across the different stories collected in
the corpus, the representation of rural life possesses negative connotations
related to the poor quality of life as well as positive ones depicting an idyllic
and bucolic environment. A second, related line of interpretation draws on
theories of the sublime, being defined by mixed feelings especially in presence
of large natural bodies such as mountain ranges and peaks (Pries).
On this same reasoning, it could be then logical to see why the results
for valence/positivity are somewhat ambiguous. Future research is of course
necessary, on a larger data base as well as digging into the data with a
more qualitative eye to understand which patterns determined our results.
Importantly, more research is needed also to to understand the different
results obtained by different sentiment lexicons, and at the same time to
evaluate their performance on historical corpora.

Examining the representation of landscape and its emotional value in German-Swiss fiction between 1840 and 1940

Our results showed that when referencing ‘factual’ locations, Swiss authors
1840-1940 have a general tendency to prefer references to their own country,
and that they do so when writing about natural and rural locations, but also
when mentioning big cities and urban centres. At the same time, they do
make ample references to German geolocations, both of which are important
findings in the light of the debate on the character and development of
a Swiss national literature. In fact, the ‘paradoxical’ position in between
a national Swiss distinction and the adherence to a transnational German
literary system is well described in the literature (Haupt). Both strands need
further testing, in particular on a larger data base and through a comparison
with a similar corpus of German and Austrian literary texts.
Our examination leaves open ground to many other questions, such as the
effects of genre types on affective encoding (including constructions such as
low-brow vs. mid- and highbrow, or the degree of heteronomy of genre),
as well as how plot structure and characters feature in relation to space
and affect. Else, irony may be studied as a correlate of affect in the typical
village-stories, while a taxonomy of ‘the sublime’ may provide a more stable
ground for our still speculative interpretation for the richer emotional range
in rural settings. After all, our findings did not measure the proportion
of (conflicting) emotions at story level (for an approach to measuring a
story affect potential, see. What is more, follow-up studies may run analyses
on ‘villages’ and ‘small towns,’ as compared to ‘alpine spaces’ and ‘urban
interior space’ in a finer grained spatial analysis (Herrmann and Grisot).
These may come to terms with sub-genres of landscape-oriented genres.
Particularly relevant appears here a specific Swiss history of technology and
industrial infrastructure during industrialisation, with hydroelectric power
plants (instead of coal and oil), the construction of infrastructure (tunnels
and the railway) all of which acquired topological or even mythical status
in Swiss literature (Wege). Finally, our quantitative results support the
assumption that while generally marked by the transition from modes of
realism to modes of modernism throughout European literatures, the period
1840-1940 appears to function a bit differently in Switzerland. Our data have
indeed shown that, next to the rural/urban affective divide, certain ‘Swissspecific’ features are making themselves visible: the rural, the realistic, and the
tension between self-reference and Germany-orientation. We cannot wait to
venture deeper into the valleys and among these ranges, with a combination
of qualitative and quantitative studies.
