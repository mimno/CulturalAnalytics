time. The proportion of female faces first peaked in the mid-to-late 1940s. This was
followed by a dip lasting from the mid-1950s to the early 1960s. The 1970s saw another
peak followed by a dip over the course of the 1980s. Finally, we see a slow and steady rise
in the proportion of female faces from the early 1990s onwards. In this paper, we seek to
make sense of these variations through an interdisciplinary framework drawing on
psychology, visual studies (in particular, photography theory), and history. Through a close
reading of our Time archive from the 1940s through the 1990s, we conclude that the visual
representation of women in Time magazine correlates with attitudes toward women in both
the historical context of the era and the textual content of the magazine.

Beginning with its inception in 1923, Time magazine, perhaps more than any other
comparable publication, has both reflected and influenced American popular
attitudes toward domestic and global politics. This includes the changing ideas about
women since the mid-twentieth century, which is the subject of this paper. Our
approach was two-fold. We used supervised machine learning to extract visual
images of faces from an archive of Time magazine, which contains 3,389 issues
ranging from 1923 to 2014, and computationally classified the faces as male or
female. We then closely read selected Time articles to make sense of this quantitative
data against the background of postwar feminism and the history of the magazine
itself. Our focus is on the period between the 1940s and the 1990s, which witnessed
significant changes in attitudes toward women, and where our data of the proportion
of female faces exhibits significant fluctuation.
We found four clear phases in the visual representation of women in Time from the
1940s to the 1990s: a peak in the mid-to-late 1940s, a dip from the mid-1950s to

WHAT’S IN A FACE? GENDER REPRESENTATIONS OF FACES IN TIME, 1940-1990

early 1960s, another peak in the 1970s, and another dip in the 1980s. The number of
female faces depicted in Time has again risen steadily since the early-1990s.
Through our combined quantitative and qualitative approach, we found that the
percentage of female faces found in Time between the 1940s and 1990s correlates
with attitudes towards women in both the larger historical context as well as within
the textual content of the magazine.
This paper is organized as follows: we begin with an examination of the
psychological and historical import of visual and particularly photographic images
of faces and then present our data-collection methodology and results. Finally, we
provide an interpretation of the variations in the representation of female faces in
Time from the 1940s to the 1990s.

Why faces?
What’s in a face? Why is this particular photographic subject so worthy of attention?
The answer is at once psychological and historical. As contemporary psychologists
have shown, our recognition of faces is intrinsic to our human identity. Cathy
Mondloch demonstrated that a baby can identify a face -- “Two eyes, aligned
horizontally, above a nose, above a mouth” – as early as seven minutes after birth,
an innate sensitivity that only intensifies afterwards.1 We pick up basic social cues
through faces, particularly the trustworthiness of others with whom we interact
socially.
The power of this pattern -- two eyes, above a nose, above a mouth – extends to
images of faces as well. The art historian and psychologist Ernst Gombrich proposed
a thought experiment to demonstrate this: he dares anyone who doubts the power of
facial images to tear up a photograph of someone they admire. They will, he argues,
find this a near impossible task.2 Faces, even in the form of photographic
representations have an arguably primal hold over us.
The power of facial images also bears on our consciousness of human history. As
Tessa Morris-Suzuki notes, historical photographs of faces “evoke empathy,”
pushing us towards novel understandings of others whom we have not met, and may
never meet.3 Faces from the past transmitted through photographs charge our
2

imaginations with “expressions of joy or terror … fleeting moments of triumph or
disaster … projected through time into the present moment.”4
The Vietnam War provides a striking example. As Susan Sontag reminds us, Trảng
Bàng’s 1972 infamous photo of the child Phan Thị Kim Phúc OOnt, running towards
the camera, covered in napalm and screaming in pain, did more to sour Americans
on Cold War imperialism than the barrage of televisual images that flooded
American homes from 1955 to 1975.5 In a phenomenon much like that described by
Gombrich, we find it hard to look away from such a face, because we instinctively
empathize with the agony conveyed through it. It could be our own face, were we
subject to such extreme circumstances. The images we explore in our Time archive
are less harrowing than this, but the same phenomenon holds: photographs of faces
are powerful cultural symbols, transcending time and space.

Methodology and Results
Automatic Face Extraction and Gender Classification
The Time magazine archive for this study consists of 3,389 issues, from 1923 to
2014, which comprises approximately 500,000 .jpg files, with one file for each page
of each issue.
We used supervised machine learning to automatically extract all of the faces from
the archive by creating a set of training data, where human labor was used to identify,
extract, and classify the gender of faces. The training data consisted of two sets: 1)
one issue, selected at random from each of the ten decades spanned by the archive,
and 2) one randomly selected July issue from each year between 1961 and 1991 for
a total of 39 issues. These issues were chosen to represent the range of the archive,
while allowing us to concentrate on one period of historical interest. Crowdsourcing
was used to extract and classify faces from this subset via a custom-built web
application deployed within Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). The full details of
our web application and our data verification procedures have been detailed
elsewhere.6

Working in batches of 50 .jpg files, 87 AMT workers examined 3,772 pages and
extracted 4,685 faces. A different set of 342 AMT workers reviewed the extracted
faces and annotated them according to several characteristics, including gender,
race, and image quality. Verification images with known outcomes were included in
all AMT batches and multiple annotations for each face were aggregated. Our
procedure is fully detailed and examined elsewhere.7 Described briefly, we
calculated a proficiency rating for each coder by considering all images they
annotated. Each image was annotated by two coders, and when annotations
conflicted, we chose the one from the coder with the highest proficiency rating.
These faces, extracted and classified by AMT workers, became the training data for
the machine learning extraction and classification models.
The AMT data was used to train a RetinaNet detector8 to automatically identify and
extract faces from the remainder of the archive. The model was trained for twenty
epochs9, since a greater number than this led to overfitting and poor generalization
across different eras. An initial round of extractions was done using an accuracy
threshold of only 50 percent in an attempt to collect possibly obscure faces, such as
those found in illustrations. This produced 430,324 images; however, many were
duplicates with different sized bounding boxes. Therefore, a second round of
extractions was done with an accuracy threshold of 90 percent, yielding 327,322
faces. These images were automatically classified according to their gender.
A pre-trained face descriptor convolutional neural network VGGFace10 was then
fine-tuned and used to classify each face as either male or female. The model was
first trained for 100 epochs using the data gathered from AMT. Out of the 4,685
images gathered, 4,405 were used, with 3,082 male and 1,323 female images. The
remaining 280 images categorized as “unknown” gender were eliminated from this
analysis, due to their relatively infrequent occurrence and the fact that many of them
were not human faces. This data was then split 70/30% into a training set and a test
set. The training set was then further split 70/30% into true training data and
validation data. The first round of training resulted in a model with an accuracy of
87 percent. From the test images, 909 of the 983 male faces were correctly classified
as male, and 241 of the 340 female faces were correctly classified as female, as
shown in the left-hand side of Figure 1.

Figure 1: Confusion matrices for the respective testing sets after the first and second rounds of training. Row indicates
true class membership, while columns indicate the predicted class. The first round used 4,405 training images, roughly
75% of which were men. The second round used 17,698 with roughly an even proportion of men and women.

Due to the large discrepancy between the number of male faces and number of
female faces, the number of training and test images were increased in order to
improve the training accuracy. Using the first model trained, all 327,322 faces were
classified as male or female and then a random set was selected to expand the
training data. These images were manually verified as male or female, and any that
were incorrect were assigned the proper classification. For the second round of
training, the dataset was expanded to 9,300 male faces and 8,398 female faces, which
were then split into training and test sets using the same split (70/30%) used in the
first round. The model was trained again for 100 epochs, resulting in a much higher
accuracy of 95 percent. Out of the 2,790 male faces in the test set, 2,677 were
correctly classified as male; out of the 2,520 female faces, 2,366 were correctly
classified as female, as shown in the right-hand side of Figure 1. This more accurate
model was then used to classify all 327,322 faces for analysis.
To investigate whether the computational algorithm and the human AMT coders
functioned differently, the proportion of faces that were classified as women
(hereafter, “proportion of women” will be used) in each year was calculated for the
data generated by both processes. We increased the volume of our AMT data by
adding one additional July issue for each year, except for the 1961-1991 span already
collected in the first set, so that our total AMT data set includes at least one issue per
year. We note that the sample size is different for the AMT data set versus the
computationally acquired data set: the AMT data consists of one issue (sometimes
two issues) per year, while the automated data contains all of the issues in each year.

Nonetheless, as shown in Figure 2, similar patterns emerge from both data sets,
including an increase in the proportion of female faces from the 1920s to 1945, a
post-Second World War dip, a rebound beginning in the mid-1960s, followed by a
decrease in the 1980’s, and a final rebound beginning in the early-1990s.

Figure 2: The percentage of women aggregated per year for each data set. The data labeled MTurk consists of 1 to
2 issues per year that were classified by human coders. The data labeled Auto consists of all the issues in our
archive. The solid lines are a LOWESS smoothed version of the data.

Since similar trend lines were found using the AMT and the automatic extraction
data, our analysis focuses on the latter, more comprehensive data set. To investigate
long-term, broad patterns in Time’s visual representation, the average number of
faces per page in each year was calculated. Figure 3 indicates that the number of
faces sharply increased from the early 1920’s through to about 1940, before
oscillating with a slight increasing trend thereafter.

data.

The proportion of women in each issue was also calculated. Figure 4 provides a
longitudinal summary of results. As expected, the variance on a per issue basis is
much larger than the per year variance illustrated in Figure 2, but the same general
trends hold. Charting the proportion of women in each issue was useful for
identifying outliers for our close reading analysis. For example, we can immediately
note that over 70% of the faces in the March 20, 1972 issue of Time magazine belong
to women, compared to the averaged trendline, which peaks at around 30% in the
1970s.

Ascertainment of Contextual Data
In order to interpret the image data, we first situated it within the broader context of
events in the 20th century and then analyzed Time itself to ascertain how it reflects
this historical context. Our analysis consisted of a close reading of selected issues
and articles, chosen based on the following criteria: 1) outlier issues from Figure 4
defined as those between 1940 and 1990 with > 40% women, 2) issues and articles
that were referenced in our secondary sources, and 3) results from EBSCO’s
Academic Search Complete database, which we used to retrieve all articles in which
the word ‘woman’ or ‘women’ or ‘housewife’ was mentioned in the article within
our dates of interest.

A Note on Gender
While we acknowledge that gender is not binary, we note that this analysis assumes
that gender falls into binary male and female categories. We justify this assumption
based on the media portrayal of gender in our period of interest (1940s-1990s),

7

WHAT’S IN A FACE? GENDER REPRESENTATIONS OF FACES IN TIME, 1940-1990

which, for the most part, did not include non-binary genders. We did not see any
evidence of non-binary gender representation in Time magazine in our archive in
those years. Our human-coded AMT data, ranging from 1923 to 2014, includes an
‘unknown’ category for gender, but in a subset of this data that we analyzed, the
‘unknown’ gender category accounted for only about 6% of the faces, and none of
these were actually gender non-binary adult individuals: many were not faces at all
(errors in the face extraction), many were very small low resolution images that were
hard to read, some were non-gendered cartoon illustrations (a face drawn onto an
object, for example), and some were infants or small children.

Interpretation of Results
Here we provide an interpretation of the temporal variations that we observed in our
data, focusing on attitudes toward gender through the lens of Time magazine
between 1940 and 1990.

The Second World War and the Early Postwar Era 1941-1965
Our data shows that the visual representation of women increased during the era of
American involvement in the Second World War. As men went abroad to fight in
the war, women’s role in the workforce expanded beyond traditional ‘feminine’
occupations to fill the gap and to satisfy increased production in the defense
industry,11 a situation that challenged the “prevailing wisdom that wedlock and
motherhood” were the proper roles for mid-twentieth century women.12 Government
and media alike encouraged women to take on these new roles, as exemplified by
Rosie the Riveter on Norman Rockwell’s Memorial Day 1943 Saturday Evening
Post cover (Figure 5).13

Accordingly, Time magazine ran stories about women ably participating in the war,
including the following examples. The November 2 1942 issue featured a very
flattering profile on bomber pilot Jacqueline Cochran, the “No. 1 feminine flyer of
the U.S.”14 In the February 22,1943 issue, there was a report about the US Marine
Corps recruiting women, stating that Marine Corps officials had “noted with
approval the quietly efficient job done by women in military service in Britain.”15
The April 26, 1943 issue ran a story on equality for women doctors, raising concern
that discrimination is leaving women doctors out of military service, where they are
desperately needed.16
In the August 9, 1943, issue, Time’s sister publication Life featured a photojournalistic piece by Margaret Bourke-White chronicling women working in steel
factories (See Figure 6). The piece notes that in “1941 only 1% of aviation
employees were women, while this year [1943] they will comprise an estimated 65%
of the total”, and that these women “have proved that in time of crisis no job is too
tough for American women.”17

Figure 6: August 9, 1943 cover of Life magazine

As the war came to a close, concern arose that there would be few jobs available to
men returning from the war. A women’s bureau survey reported that 75% of women
wanted to continue working outside the home after the war18, a sentiment that was
reflected in a report from Canada in Time magazine in the May 5, 1944 issue, which
reported on Mrs. Dorise Neilsen (a member of Parliament) raising a point in question
at the House of Commons. She wondered out loud what women’s “position will be
when the war is over. Are the governments and employers going to say: 'Well, girls,
you have done a nice job; you looked very cute in your overalls and we appreciate
what you have done for us; but run along now; go home; we can get along without
you?'”.19 Unfortunately, her fears were materialized as women were laid off in large
numbers at the end of the war.20
Here we can see the economic/political/cultural force of Fordism with particular
clarity: as early as 1916, Henry Ford set social workers upon ‘Ford families’ to
ensure that they were educated – or, rather disciplined – in the practices of “moral
probity, family life, and the capacity for prudent [and] rational consumption”.21 In
the post-WWII period, this corporate cultural innovation became national social
policy, as women across North America were instructed by “social engineers, such
as psychologists, that they needed to be good wives and mothers in order to fit
normally into post-war life”.22 Time magazine reported in the October 8, 1951 issue
that Mills College (a liberal arts college for women) in Oakland California, under
10

JOURNAL OF CULTURAL ANALYTICS

their new president Lynn White Jr, would shift its focus to making students
“successful housewives”. A new major in ‘family studies’ was created, which not
only imparted skills in domestic duties and raising children, but, more importantly,
inculcated the right ‘attitude’ toward it. White was concerned that many women who
went to college felt that being a housewife was demeaning, and he set out to change
that attitude.23 Of course, mass media would be another crucial site for such
‘instruction’ (See Figure7 for an example).

Figure 7: Advertisement from October 8, 1951 issue of Time magazine

Our data reinforces this historical trend, as a decline in the proportion of female faces
in the postwar issues of Time is clear, and we observe that the tone toward women
often oriented them away from the workplace and toward the home. For example,
an article in the July 2, 1956 issue of Time entitled ‘The Care and Feeding of
Women’ provides tips on how to “handle” women in the workplace such as “don’t
yield to a woman’s tears” and “bear in mind that women take things personally”.24
But most interestingly, we observe that in this postwar 1950s era, when high-profile
women were featured, they are often referred to as housewives, despite their
professional accomplishments, and even if they weren’t actually housewives. For
example, in 1951, Time reports on renowned artist Honoré Sharrer’s groundbreaking exhibition of Tribute to the American Working People with an article titled

11

WHAT’S IN A FACE? GENDER REPRESENTATIONS OF FACES IN TIME, 1940-1990

“Hardworking Housewife”, where she is not referred to as an artist, but as a
housewife and later as a painter-housewife. The article also makes a point of stating
that she is pretty.25 World-record breaking Olympian Dorothy Tyler was featured in
an August 1956 issue with an article entitled “High-jumping housewife”, which
establishes her first and foremost as a housewife before going on to describe her
many accomplishments, including her war-time participation in the air force.26 An
article in 1958 featuring the influential business columnist Sylvia Porter is entitled
“Housewife’s View”, despite the fact that she was always a full-time writer and
never a housewife. The last paragraph in the article mentions that while she spends
the weekends with her husband in Upper Westchester County, “every Monday
Sylvia returns to an apartment on lower Fifth Avenue and to her office at the Post,
where—puffing Philip Morris cigarettes and rattling off her sentences at a deadlineracing clip—she delights in making as many dollars and as much sense as she can
out of the clutter of financial facts”.27
The change in tone toward women between the Second World War era and the postwar era that accompanied the decrease in the proportion of images of women’s faces
in Time is sometimes stark. It is interesting to contrast Time magazine’s ‘Woman’s
Place’ feature from the July 19, 1943 issue, which presented a laudatory profile of
the capable Anne Josephine Shofner, hands-on owner of a steel-casting plant,28 with
the ‘Woman’s Place’ feature from the October 9, 1964 issue, which highlighted the
work and doctrine of Phyllis McGinley, who believed that a woman’s place was in
the home serving her husband.29

The women’s liberation movement 1965-1979
By the mid-1960s, a mass women’s liberation movement had begun to take shape.
It was underpinned by social and technological innovations, including the
breakdown of traditional patriarchal ideas of marriage and the invention and
commercialization of the birth-control pill. These were accompanied by a revolution
in attitudes, as women activated by Feminist ideas “fought to make space for
woman’s authentic voice” across the whole of society.30
These changing attitudes also brought about changes in American society’s structure
and rules. During this time period, there were a series of landmark court cases

12

JOURNAL OF CULTURAL ANALYTICS

reversing gender discrimination, including Weeks v. Southern Bell in 1965, which
opened many previously male-only jobs to women;31 Reed v Reed in 1971, which
marked the first time the US Supreme Court struck down a law that treats men and
women differently;32 and Taylor v. Louisiana in 1975, which denied states the right
to exclude women from juries.33 Throughout this process of emancipation, the
profile of women in the public sphere rose.
Our findings correlate strongly with this shifting role of women. In the pages of
Time, we saw a clear uptick in the percentage of faces identified as female, peaking
at the height of the women’s movement in the mid-1970s to about 30% per issue.
Time magazine reported on the changes brought about by the women’s liberation
movement. The August 31, 1970 issue of Time featured prominent feminist writer
Kate Millett on the cover, and a woman, artist Alice Neel was commissioned to paint
the cover portrait. The issue included an essay by Gloria Steinem, entitled “What it
Would be Like if Women Win”, imagining a world in which men and women were
considered truly equal,34 and a feature story entitled “Who’s Come a Long Way,
Baby?”,35 dedicated to the diversity and strength of the women’s movement.
Although this story provides fair coverage of the diversity of the movement and its
aims, the tone (as exemplified by the title) is still clearly oriented toward an all-male
audience, playing into fears of the changes gender equality would bring. Despite
clearly stating women’s case, citing many examples of discrimination, the article
opens with “These are the times that try men’s souls, and they are likely to get much
worse before they get better”.36

Figure 8: August 31, 1970 cover of Time magazine

Another Time magazine issue of note is the March 20, 1972 special issue entitled
“The American Woman”, entirely devoted to exploring the notion of the American
woman within the context of the women’s liberation movement (See Figures 9 and
10). This particular issue is a significant anomaly in our data, with 70.5% of the
faces in that issue belonging to women, compared with an average of under 30% for
the total of that year. The cover story provides an in-depth view of the women’s
movement, and other articles therein feature profiles of activist women. Again, as
with the 1970 Kate Millet issue, the tone reveals the gender perspective of the
writing. The introduction to the special issue wonders whether or not the feminist
movement was just another 1960s fad, on par with Hippies, Yippies, and other
relatively insignificant players produced by that decade.37 While this introduction
notes that the women’s movement is characteristically American in its belief in selfreliance and desire to change old traditions, the overall tone of many of the articles
in the issue is anthropological, as if women were not part of American society, but
an ‘other’ to be examined and analyzed, which again, suggests that it was written for
men by men.

20, 1972 page 25.

A gendered division of labor played an important part in Time’s barely-concealed
animus toward the liberation of women. Until the 1970s, the job roles at Time
magazine were strictly segregated by gender, where the men were the writers and
editors, while the women were in the subjugated roles of researchers and factcheckers.38 Time co-founder Briton Hadden is credited with inventing the system,
and believed that the quasi-adversarial roles of male writer versus female researcher
would create a sexual dynamic that would energize the process.39 In reality, it was
no more than a gender-based caste system, where women spent their entire careers
relegated to the lower rank of ‘researcher.’ College-educated women with years of
experience had little to no opportunity of moving up in the ranks, while men were
hired directly into writing jobs fresh out of college and rapidly promoted to editor.40
Furthermore, women were not being credited for their vital roles in the publication.41
This situation shaped coverage of women and women’s issues – written and
pictorially – at a fundamental level.

Figure 10: Photograph of liberationist group meeting at the Los Angeles women’s center, featured in the cover story
entitled “Where She Is and Where She’s Going”, Time, March 20, 1972 page 27.

In 1965, a year after the passage of the Civil Rights Act, Time’s personnel policies
were reviewed and questioned for the first time. The findings of the internal review
found the paucity of women in important jobs to be a management failure.42 Despite
this damning report, little changed. In December 1969, the New York Times
mentioned women’s situation at Time and made note of the fact that bright women
were stuck as researchers throughout their career.43 It was at this time that the
women’s liberation movement began to transcend beyond being a novel topic to be
covered by the news magazine to something that affected the inner workings of the
institution itself.
Capitalizing on the attention that the New York Times article brought to the issue, a
group of women employed at Time filed a complaint with the New York States
Human Rights Commission in 1970, charging the company with “placing men in
writing and managerial positions while placing college-educated women in lower
positions where they can expect little or no upward advancement.”44 This action
spurred management to begin to hire women as writers and editors, though it was
not until 1972 that the policy began to have a significant effect.45
After this point, Time’s coverage of women changed. More stories about women’s
issues made it into print, and the editorial slant targeting men wary of feminism was
steadily de-emphasized. The June 4, 1973 issue, for instance, featured an article
entitled “Women Battle Bias” covering the discriminatory credit policies of
16

JOURNAL OF CULTURAL ANALYTICS

American banks.46 A summary of a report by the Carnegie Commission on Higher
Education entitled “Opportunities for Women in Higher Education,” which detailed
systematic discrimination against female students, professors, and administrators in
academia was featured in the October 1, 1973 issue.47 These stories were told fully
and critically, avoiding the pandering to men that characterized Time’s coverage of
feminism up to that point. Women’s accomplishments were no longer underrated.
The recurring ‘A Woman’s Place’ feature in the October 21, 1974 issue is dedicated
to Antonia Brico, the first woman to conduct the Berlin Philharmonic, and favorably
reviews the biopic, Antonia: A Portrait of the Woman, directed by two women, Judy
Collins and Jill Godmillow.48

The backlash of the 1980s
By the late-1970s, a backlash against the feminist movement had started to
materialize.49 Important factors in this shift in public opinion included the
conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly’s campaign against the Equal Rights
Amendment (ERA) and, from the other end of the political spectrum, an erosion of
the early-1960s universalist consensus spearheaded by leaders such as Betty Freidan,
Kate Millett, and Gloria Steinem as “minority” women of color and lesbians
challenged the character of the movement as white, heterosexual, and upper-middle
class.50 Such critiques, although perfectly healthy for a counter-hegemonic
movement as seismic as postwar Feminism, were seized upon as signs of weakness
in the larger mainstream discourse.
These fractures, divisions, and backlash were reflected in Time magazine. The
September 26, 1977 issue featured a story entitled “Women’s Movement Under
Siege”, which covered the biennial meeting of the National Women’s Political
Caucus in San Jose, California51, and the multiple perspectives of the women therein.
The tone was grim at the caucus as women foresaw trouble from anti-feminists at
the upcoming Women’s Conference in Houston. The December 5, 1977 issue
covered the conference with a long report entitled “What Next for US Women?”52
In addition to covering the conference, the article also extensively covered the
conference protestors and the anti-feminist women leading the “pro-family”
movement, realizing one of the fears voiced by women at the caucus in San Jose –

17

WHAT’S IN A FACE? GENDER REPRESENTATIONS OF FACES IN TIME, 1940-1990

that the media would indulge the public with a “women-against-women
bloodbath.”53
This reactionary drift was, as our quantitative analysis reveals, reflected in a
decreased proportion of women in Time during the 1980s relative to the 1970s. This
drop in the representation of women is consistent with the analysis in Susan Faludi’s
well-known book Backlash,54 in which she describes the 1980s as a decade that
rejected feminism. Here we describe this backlash, and how Time magazine both
reflected and participated in it.
Women’s issues in the 1980s were plagued by a concatenation of right-wing politics
articulated with right-wing Christianity. In 1979, Jerry Falwell founded the ‘Moral
Majority’, a right-wing Christian political organization that sought to restore what it
considered a traditional family life. In 1980, Ronald Reagan, endorsed by the Moral
Majority, was elected president. One important theme in Reagan’s political message
was his opposition to feminist demands.55 A prime example of this was his vocal
opposition against ratifying the Equal Right Amendment. The ERA did not pass by
the 1982 deadline, which was a major setback to the women’s movement. Bolstered
by this development, anti-feminist voices only grew louder. For example, in 1988,
Rush Limbaugh’s national radio show began airing, through which he coined and
popularized the term ‘feminazi’ to describe feminists.
While the anti-feminism of the 1970s defended gender roles with traditionalist or
religious beliefs, the anti-feminism that emerged in the 1980s falsely asserted that
feminism was no longer necessary because women had already achieved equality,56
and that the remaining discourse only duped women into being unnecessarily
unhappy with their lot in life.57 These increasingly influential attitudes were reflected
in the cover story of Time’s December 4, 1989 issue (see Figure 11).58 It depicted a
beleaguered woman holding a baby in one hand and a briefcase in the other. The
subtitle underlined that “In the 80s, [women] tried to have it all. Now they’ve just
plain had it.” Driving the point home, Time asked: “Is there a future for feminism?”

Popular media, as Faludi charged, played an active role in propagating narratives
that subverted feminism in the 1980s, suggesting – evidence to the contrary – that
feminist ideas had made women’s lives miserable. A striking example of this can be
found in two 1980s studies on women’s issues.59 In 1987, Shere Hite released
“Women and Love: A Cultural Revolution in Progress”, which examined survey
data from 4,500 women about their personal relationships. It revealed that 80% of
the women surveyed struggled to assert their independence and earn the respect of
their male partners.60 Instead of highlighting the patriarchal social component of
these findings, popular media coverage focused instead on Hite’s eccentric personal
characteristics.61 Time made the study its cover story in its October 12, 1987 issue,
characterizing it as a manifestation of “extreme views,” while dismissing the 4,500
participants involved as “strident, “malcontent[ed]” women.62 The story gave more
print space to Hite’s critics than to describing the work itself. While the voices in
the book are forlorn, with many describing years of systematic emotional abuse at
the hands of their husbands, Time magazine chose to illustrate the article about the
book with images of women overpowering or attacking men (see Figure 12).63 In
contrast, at the same time, Time was celebrating Dr. Srully Blotnick’s book
“Otherwise Engaged: The Private Lives of Successful Women”, which concluded
that success at work poisons the lives of women.64

a furor over sex and love in the 1980s”, Time magazine October 12, 1987 pages 68-73

As a larger number of women started entering the workforce and developing their
careers in the 1970s, the average age at which women had their first child started to
increase. Faludi notes that the media reaction to this development was to instill and
propagate panic about the risk of infertility.65 The media attack was two-pronged:
1) scare women with stories about infertility over age 30, and 2) highlight happy
stories about young women having children.66 Time’s February 22, 1982 issue (see
Figure 13) exemplifies both, with the cover story “The New Baby Bloom: Career
women are opting for pregnancy and they’re doing it in style”,67 and a feature story
inside about the "medical risks" of waiting after 30 to have babies.68

Meanwhile, movie and television portrayals of women in this era were often reduced
to one dimension, featuring the gendered stereotypes of the unhinged independent
woman and the saintly beautiful housewife. Faludi details the trend in late 1980s
cinema to demonize independent women, with Fatal Attraction leading the charge.69
While in television, the traditional patriarchal family was featured in hit sitcoms,
with the Cosby show being most popular.70
One of the most insidious ways in which popular media undermined feminism in the
1980s – a template that persists to this day – is how it differentiates successful
women from successful men. A clear example can be seen in Time’s August 7, 1989
issue, which features the broadcast journalist Dianne Sawyer. Sawyer had just joined
the ABC primetime show alongside a male co-anchor, Sam Donaldson. Time’s cover
featured Sawyer’s image with a question in bold font, suggesting alarm: “Is she
worth it?,” making reference to Sawyer’s salary. High profile male journalists,
including Donaldson, were never questioned in this way in the pages of Time.

The 1990s and beyond
By the 1990s, the tide again shifted in favor of feminism. In 1991, Anita Hill testified
in Congress, accusing Clarence Thomas – a jurist nominated by President George
H.W. Bush for the Supreme Court – of sexual harassment. She was one of many who
claimed such harassment by Thomas, but was the only one who agreed to testify on
the issue. Despite her testimony, Thomas was confirmed.71 Sexual harassment
became a national conversation, and Hill’s allegations and Thomas’ confirmation
gave feminism and the issue of sexual harassment new life in the 1990s.72 A record
number of women were elected to Congress the following year, spurred on by the
controversy, almost doubling by 1992, from 28 to 47.73 The number of women in the
Senate also tripled, from 3 to 9.74 Meanwhile, President Clinton appointed Madeline
Albright as Secretary of State and Janet Reno as Attorney General,75 and had more
women in cabinet positions than Bush 41 or Reagan. Our data derived from the Time
archive magazine demonstrates that the number of women’s faces in the magazine
rose accordingly by the mid-1990s.
In 1995, the Global Media Monitoring Project76 began creating, for the first time, a
quantitative measure of women’s representation in media. This project – an

21

WHAT’S IN A FACE? GENDER REPRESENTATIONS OF FACES IN TIME, 1940-1990

inspiration for our own efforts – drew attention to the fact that by 1995, the
representation of women hadn’t significantly changed since the 1970s.77 This
observation is consistent with our own quantitative analysis of Time from the 1970s
to the 1990s, in which the percentage of female faces, after climbing out of the dip
in the 1980s, is about the same in the mid-1990s as it was at the height of the
women’s movement in the 1970s. From the mid-1990s onward, we observe a small
but steady rise in representation.

Discussion and Conclusion
In order to contextualize our Time archive, we must draw attention to the post-1940s
explosion of increasingly powerful imagery in all areas of social life: a situation
famously characterized by one author as the advent of the “Society of the Spectacle,”
in which social relations between people are increasingly “mediated by images,”
including images of faces utilized for myriad commercial and political ends.78
Imagery took on a remarkable significance in the latter-half of the twentieth century,
one which is more pressing than ever today (and reflected in social media sites such
as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat). Our data in Figure 3 reflects how images sharply
rose in prevalence around mid-century, and have continued to slowly rise since. Ours
is, in an important sense, a “post-literate” world of unprecedented “density of visual
messages.” Images, beginning in the Second World War, and accelerating ever
since, are used by politicians, bureaucrats, law enforcement, and capitalists to sort,
control, and manipulate people.79 They have been used just as much by the masses
to understand (through sorting, controlling, and manipulating) the dynamism of their
own lives. As Susan Sontag put it in her 1977 classic, On Photography, our relations
to pictures under the conditions of postmodernist culture put us into “a certain
relation to the world that feels like knowledge – and therefore like power.”80 This is
why our examination of gender from the 1940s to the 1990s is focused on imagery.
Accordingly, we observed that the proportion of images of women’s faces printed
in Time magazine within a time period tracks closely with the attitudes towards
women in that era.
We should note, however, that there are limitations to reading too much into a single
statistically derived number, such as the proportion of images of women’s faces. It
is not only the absolute number of images of women that may change as attitudes
22

JOURNAL OF CULTURAL ANALYTICS

change, but also the way in which they are represented. An image of a woman does
not necessarily reveal whether the context is empowering or disempowering, even
in a news-story framework. For example, the media attention on Monica Lewinsky
in the 1990s was, for the most part, sexist and humiliating. So, we caution against
making too strong of a generalization from our findings. Another limitation of our
method is that the machine classification of gender isn’t perfect: the error rate was
about 6.5% for women and about 4.2% for men (see Figure 1). Furthermore, the
algorithm cannot differentiate between someone who identifies as a woman and
someone who presents as female. Our AMT data mitigates this problem by using
human coders who see the context of the page, but that set of data is much smaller
than our data collected with automated processes. However, the AMT data is much
richer in terms of content as we had coders label other characteristics beyond gender,
such as race, age (adult or child), the context in which the face appears
(advertisement or feature story), and whether or not the face is smiling.
In future work, we would like to examine all of the characteristics labeled in the
AMT data, and perhaps try to automate some of these classifications as well. We
are particularly interested in examining the context in which each face appears
(whether it is in an advertisement or a feature story). We plan to separate the
advertisements from our archive and examine how faces, in particular women, are
represented in ads across the archive, and how this compares to images in feature
stories.
In conclusion, we found that a distant reading of the images of faces in Time
magazine is consistent with a historical analysis of American socio-political trends
and with a close reading of the magazine’s content. Specifically, we found that the
percentage of faces that present as female peaks during eras when women have been
more active in public life, and wanes in eras of backlash against women’s rights.
This finding is particularly relevant in our contemporary post-literate world in which
people absorb culture through images, and spend more time scanning images than
reading print content.
