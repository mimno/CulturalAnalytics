ABSTRACT
In this article, we present a newly established corpus of 11,955 sermon manuscripts written by
pastors in the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Denmark (ELCD) in 2011-2016. We argue that
this corpus provides a resource for studying how pastors within the same religious institution
attend to general themes in church and society, respond to contemporary events, and represent
social worlds. The aim of the article is twofold. 1) To present and discuss our approach to acquire
and assemble the sermons corpus. This approach entailed sampling sermons directly from
Danish pastors, and cleaning the corpus and annotating it with metadata manually. 2) To
demonstrate the research potential of the corpus through a case study on gender representations
in the sermons. We find that male and female pastors differ in their use of fundamental linguistic
components, namely gendered pronouns and associated verbs. This affects how they assign
agency to male and female characters in the corpus, and indicate that male and female pastors
shape the social worlds in sermons in quite different ways. This case study therefore illustrates
just one of the ways in which corpus-based research of Danish sermons may provide novel
insights in the field of religion and society.

The role of religion in contemporary democratic societies is a complex topic. A
tendency within the study of religion has been to assert that religion today emerges
primarily in individualized spiritual forms that have displaced the relevance of the
old religious traditions in society – in the European context, of the old Christian
majority churches in particular.1 In Denmark, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in
Denmark (ELCD) still represents the majority religion, inscribed in the constitution
and subsidized as such by the state through church taxes. The ELCD is present in
the public sphere in Denmark, but as an institution, the church has no distinct agency
that speaks in public on behalf of the ELCD: it has no unified voice to respond to
societal change or crises, to address ethical matters, or to prioritize particular societal
or religious topics over others. It is individual pastors who speak for the ELCD, and

these voices are at their most distinct when they write their sermons for the weekly
service – a synchronous event in the ELCD, with pastors interpreting the same
biblical passages within a context they deem pertinent to assembled congregations
all over the country. In this endeavor, pastors are not mere agents of an organization,
sending a consistent and uniform signal to their congregations. The content of
preaching of course depends upon tradition and doctrine but preaching is also shaped
by contemporary contingencies (local and global news, natural disasters, elections,
and cultural discourses) and by the profile of the individual preachers and recipients
(gender, age, personality, and sociodemographics). This practice results in the
production of approximately 1,500 written sermons a week, a collective production
of texts which remain the property of the individual pastors after the service. From
these unique and otherwise detached documents, we can uncover the public voice of
a religious majority institution.
In this article, we present a newly established corpus of 11,955 ELCD sermons. The
corpus will provide a resource for studying how pastors within the same religious
institution attend to general themes in church and society, respond to contemporary
events, and represent social worlds. After an introduction to the religious and societal
context of which this corpus is a product, we will briefly review digital archival
resources for studying religion and sermons more generally. Against this
background, we will discuss our own careful considerations in regard to sampling,
cleaning, annotating, and archiving our corpus, a process that was predominantly
conducted manually. We further provide basic corpus statistics in order to describe
our data set. Finally, we present a case study demonstrating how pastors perform the
ELCD’s public voice when they represent gender in this newly established corpus
of sermons.

The public voice of a religious community: the Danish context
In the second half of the twentieth century, secularization theories became important
perspectives for predicting and interpreting the role of religion in democratic
societies. The secularization thesis – in its early form associated with sociologists
such as Max Weber, Émile Durkheim, and Karl Marx – stated that over time, as
rational modes of thinking in societies increased, religion would lose its ability to

2

JOURNAL OF CULTURAL ANALYTICS

set societal agendas. By the end of the century, secularization discussions were
influenced by new concepts, such as “deprivatization,” “desecularity,” and
“postsecularity,” and it was argued that societies were becoming increasingly
religious once again.2 In recent years, past secularization perspectives have been
criticized for viewing religion and the secular as two clearly distinguishable and
separate domains.3 Rather, religion in public spheres is a complex phenomenon that
unfolds in relation to other aspects of society, and not just singularly. It is therefore
pertinent to attend to the concrete cultural and societal context in which religious
phenomena unfold.
In the Danish context, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Denmark is the majority
religion. Most Danish citizens are members of the ELCD (74.7% of the Danish
population at January 1 2019). However, membership rates are slowly but steadily
declining (from 81.5% at January 1 2009). Church members tend to participate
primarily in church activities that are connected to life events – in particular funerals,
but also baptisms, confirmations, and weddings – while participation in Sunday
services is low, with an estimated 11% of members attending church services
regularly in 2017.4 From a secularization perspective, these numbers could indicate
that the church is losing its ability to remain relevant in society. Nevertheless, in
view of the societal structure of the ELCD, the church is intricately involved in the
public sphere of Danish society.
On a macro level, the church is inscribed in the constitution and as such subsidized
by government through church taxes, with church legislation handled by parliament.
The ELCD is composed of ten dioceses and bishops (four female, six male).
Dioceses are divided into deaneries, and deaneries further divided into
geographically determined parishes, each with one or more pastors employed.
Approximately two thousand pastors are employed by the ELCD. At parish level,
small congregational councils are formed in civil society to share in the running of
the local churches, a structure that was devised to rule out the possibility that a
congregation might be led by a pastor whose theology did not accommodate that of
the local population.5 The confession of the church is Evangelical–Lutheran, its
framework liberal theological. In 1948, the ELCD was the first Lutheran church in
the world to ordain women as pastors; in 2014, 55% of pastors employed by the
ELCD were women. Same-sex marriages within the ELCD were authorized in 2012.
3

SERMONS AS DATA: INTRODUCING A CORPUS OF 11,955 DANISH SERMONS

This authorization is a good example of how the branching structure of the church
works in practice: the bill was passed in parliament; bishops were required to
develop a ritual for performing the wedding ceremony; but in the end, individual
pastors could decide whether their own theological attitude was compatible with
their actually performing the ritual.6 However, accounting for the societal structures
of the ELCD gives little insight into the responses and attitudes of the church to
contemporary time and society. The structure in which the ELCD is embedded
entails that many agencies are involved in regulating church affairs and that the
church has no single, unified public voice with which to respond to societal change
or standardize theological, ethical, political, or other attitudes. Instead, this voice is
governed collectively by the pastors employed in the ELCD.
Every Sunday, individual pastors form a collective voice as they preach
simultaneously to congregations all over the country. Preaching in the ELCD is a
practice embedded within a church liturgy that includes performing the Creed,
prayers, hymn singing, the Lord’s Supper, and readings from the Bible. In the ELCD,
the biblical readings are ordered in a prescribed lectionary which determines
readings for each church holiday. There are two lectionaries: one for even years, one
for odd. The biblical readings include a text from the Old Testament; a text from the
epistles in the New Testament; and a text from one of the gospels in the New
Testament. Texts for the same holiday share thematic similarities. The pastor reads
the gospel passage aloud immediately before preaching and is obliged to preach in
consideration of this gospel passage. Compared with more strictly regulated parts of
the liturgy, though, preaching is a practice in which pastors address their
congregations from a contemporary point of view. Pastors do not merely paraphrase
the biblical passages but may instead use them to raise or reflect on existential,
societal, or philosophical issues, and they are inclined to implicitly produce,
reproduce, or divert from different discourses. As they preach, pastors are thus
engaging in a dialogue with both Christian tradition and contemporary time. Even
though attendance rates at regular ELCD services are low, this collective voice
uttered by pastors is documented in the thousands of written sermon documents that
pastors prepare in the week before the service. We argue that these documents are
immensely valuable for uncovering the attitudes and discourses that exist within a
majority Christian institution.

JOURNAL OF CULTURAL ANALYTICS

In the following, we briefly review already existing digital archival resources for the
study of religion, in order to substantiate our own approach to acquiring data.

Digital archival resources in the study of religion
Gathering and storing data on religion in databases for research purposes has been
in progress for some time. The “Index Thomasticum,” the project to index the works
of Thomas Aquinas, led by the priest Roberto Busa, is widely seen as the first largescale project within computationally informed humanities research. Newer
initiatives have been launched to develop impressive database resources for
comparative studies of religion – such as the “Database of Religious History” at
University of British Columbia7, and the “World Religion Database”8 and its
companion the “World Christian Database”9 at Boston University. Whereas these
databases provide thorough statistical information on various different religious
traditions, other attempts to develop more topic-specific databases have also
emerged, for example collections of Christian hymns in an American context
(https://hymnary.org/)10 or a collection of images of supernatural agents drawn by
children in different parts of the world.11
In comparison with these digital resources for the study of specific aspects of
religion, relatively little effort has been devoted to developing digital archives of
sermons for research purposes. Recently, though, a Pew project12 has begun to
document the online platforms where churches in the United States share sermons
publicly after church services, by creating a database of 49,719 sermons given
between April and June 2019. The sermons in this collection have been posted to
websites either as texts or in audio or video format, with the material in the latter
formats transcribed for the Pew collection. The project defines a sermon in the
following terms: “an ‘online sermon’ refers to a portion of a religious service posted
to a church website that contains a commentary from the pulpit but sometimes may
include other parts of the service as well.”13 This definition allows scope for the texts
to include excerpts from additional sequences of the church services. In their
analyses, the research group have made comparative studies of four Christian
traditions (mainline Protestant, Catholic, Evangelical and historically black

5

SERMONS AS DATA: INTRODUCING A CORPUS OF 11,955 DANISH SERMONS

Protestant denominations in the US), focusing on variations in word frequencies, in
mentions of books of the Bible, and in sermon lengths.
Rather than comparative samples of religious traditions, in our project we were
interested only in one case, namely preaching in the ELCD. We found it imperative
to invest considerable effort to delimiting the manuscripts in our corpus so as to
include only sermons, excluding any other content uttered during the church service,
as we wanted to be able to attend not just to word frequencies in the sermons but
also discursive content and semantic contexts. We therefore chose to sample
sermons as personal documents and we found that a manual approach to assembling
the corpus was the best solution to ensure adequate data quality.

Methods: acquiring sermon data and building a text corpus
To build our corpus, we collected contemporary sermon documents directly from
ELCD pastors. This procedure resulted in a collection of 11,955 sermons, written by
95 different pastors primarily between 2011 and 2016. There are 2169 ELCD
parishes in Denmark. If we conservatively assume that each of these parishes
delivers one sermon per week for each of the six years – which may not actually be
the case – this means that our corpus comprises roughly 2% of all possible sermons
delivered in Denmark during this period. The sampled material forms a case
containing comprehensive knowledge about contemporary preaching within a
national context. The corpus collection is based on opportunity sampling and
therefore is not strictly speaking a representative sample of the population of Danish
pastors. Instead, it represents preaching as collective but varied practices within the
ELCD.
Sampling, cleaning, and annotating data
Sermons challenge the traditional distinctions of social science research, as it is not
straightforward whether they should be considered as personal or official
documents. As orally delivered speeches, they are conveyed to the public on behalf
of an official institution. Nevertheless, the written manuscripts themselves remain
the property of individual pastors, meaning that sermon manuscripts are therefore
ultimately personal documents. In some parishes, where the local church publishes
6

JOURNAL OF CULTURAL ANALYTICS

the sermon online after church services, the pastors can be regarded as having
authorized their sermons as official documents. However, in contrast to American
practice, publishing sermons online after services is not customary in Denmark –
still less, recordings of church services. If pastors disseminate sermon manuscripts
online, they might be inclined to edit their original drafts, whether because of new
ideas or considerations since the service or because they are in principle addressing
a much broader audience online than in the local church. We chose to sample
sermons solely as personal documents in order to secure three objectives: to secure
access to the original, rather than the post-edited sermons; to ensure that a broad
group of pastors could provide documents; and to ensure the consent of the pastor to
assign us ownership of the material. A further criterion was that the sermons sampled
should be from an uninterrupted time span that was as recent as possible. As we
began to collect data in 2017, we delimited the sermon period as 2011–2016. This
meant that the collection would represent six recent chronological years, as well as
representing both lectionaries three times.
We were not able to obtain contact information for all Danish pastors and we
therefore employed snowball sampling to gather data. Bishops and rural deans acted
as gatekeepers for getting in contact with pastors. Nine out of ten bishops supported
our project by signing a short approval statement. We forwarded this statement to
the rural deans under the nine bishops, along with a request for them to send out an
invitation to the pastors under their supervision, inviting them to submit over email
their sermons from 2011 to 2016 in digital versions for a research project14. We
chose to let our sampling strategy be open-ended, insofar as we extended the
invitation to all ELCD pastors, while basing our response rate on self-selected
participants. We thus allowed the corpus to take on its own shape. In the first part of
the process, we did not approach the pastors ourselves, which reduced researcher
biases in sampling subjects, as the rural deans mediated our invitation. After a couple
of months, we evaluated our response rate. We then ourselves approached individual
pastors in dioceses that were under-represented in our sample, which enabled us to
control somewhat for possible ‘gatekeeper’ biases. In this second wave of sampling,
we also targeted female pastors in particular, as male pastors had been more inclined
to respond in the first wave. In the end, though, our corpus is still sampled
opportunistically. Even with a more controlled sampling method, there are a number
of confounding factors: some pastors preach more frequently than others; some
7

SERMONS AS DATA: INTRODUCING A CORPUS OF 11,955 DANISH SERMONS

pastors may not have stored or written sermons throughout the entire period; and we
were depended on the motivation of pastors to invest their own time in finding,
compiling and sending hundreds of sermons to us. We therefore found that by
allowing the sample to take its own shape, we could best achieve adequate volume
of data and most variation within the sample – even though it would not be an
entirely representative sample of sermons in the ELCD.
The confounding factors mentioned above can be seen in the material we received,
with pastors sending in differing amounts of data. Further, some pastors sent in
sermons outside the requested time period; others sent in non-sermon material
(wedding speeches, talks for various occasions) stored along with their sermons in a
heterogeneous file directory. The sermons also differed in length; in the amount of
self-composed metadata the pastors had included; and in their structuring of content.
Overall, then, the raw data was messy and unstructured. We factored these aspects
into archiving and annotating the sermons. Since we could not assume structural
consistency in the received material, the best method to accommodate all variances
was to archive and annotate manually. Five student assistants helped with the
cleaning and archiving process. The cleaning process consisted of a series of steps:
inspecting each document, to determine if it was indeed a sermon manuscript;
discarding superfluous text from the document such as hymns, biblical readings,
prayers; and finally filing each document under a unique document ID. We then
assigned metadata to each document using stand-off annotations for each cleaned
sermon document.
Metadata and data access
When the pastors sent us their original sermon documents, they provided only
content and no personal background information regarding their documents.
However, they unanimously gave consent to gather metadata and store both sermons
and metadata in a research database. The pastors gave this consent under the terms
that we would not disseminate material that could identify individual pastors
publicly. For this reason, we are required to grant access to the data only to approved
research purposes and we had to construct metadata without disclosing direct links
between sermons and individually identifiable pastors.

8

JOURNAL OF CULTURAL ANALYTICS

Metadata consists of pastor pseudonym, sermon date, holiday, size of parish, name
of diocese, birth year of pastor, gender of pastor, and where the pastor was educated.
We applied a simple pseudonymization technique to mask every pastor by numbers
1 to 95. As timestamps, we supplied the corpus with two annotations: first, the date
of the sermon, represented by year, month, day; and second, the holiday and church
year of the sermon, followed by either the letter “U” (odd years) or the letter “L”
(even years) to determine the relevant lectionary.15 We used two online resources to
provide the remaining metadata for the sermons corpus. For personal background
information, we used an online yearbook, Teologisk Stat.16 This resource is updated
by and available to Danish ELCD pastors and also to researchers at Aarhus
University through the Royal Danish Library. Through Teologisk Stat, we obtained
information about the birth year of our informants; their place of education; and their
employment history in the ELCD. This last piece of information was essential for
pastors who had changed job during the period 2011–2016. In these cases, personal
information on age, gender, and place of education remains the same for all sermons
given by the same pastor, while information relating to location varies dependent on
the dates of the sermons. We extracted information relating to location for all
parishes in which our informants had been employed throughout the 2011–2016
period from www.sogn.dk – a publicly accessible web page that contains
demographic information and statistics about ELCD parishes.

Table 1. Four random rows from the sermons metadata. From the left the columns contain: document ID, pastor ID,
date, holiday, parish size (number of ELCD-member/total number of inhabitants), diocese, birth year, gender (1 is
male, 2 is female), place of education.

The label “diocese” represents the geographical area of the sermons on a macro
scale, while “size of parish” is a micro-scale indicator of demographic variation
between congregations in the parishes. We chose these labels as locative indicators
in order to meet the condition that links between sermons and metadata capable of
disclosing the identities of individual pastors should not be provided. Had we applied

9

SERMONS AS DATA: INTRODUCING A CORPUS OF 11,955 DANISH SERMONS

finer-grained information about geographical areas through labels such as the name
of the deanery or parish, individual pastors could have been identifiable by
combining locative variables with personal ones. Table 1 above shows an excerpt of
the sermons metadata17.
As pastors by default disseminate religious attitudes while preaching, the individual
sermon manuscripts in themselves contain personal and sensitive information and
are by no means anonymized by our efforts. Further, pastors are quite likely to
mention the name of the parish or names of congregants – for instance at baptisms
and confirmation services – and their personal experiences as they prepare their
sermons for a local and delimited audience. These factors would make it possible to
identify concrete pastors by scrutinizing individual sermons. We were therefore
obliged to provide a secure solution for storage of the sermons corpus, including
metadata, and access to the data has to remain restricted to protect our informants.
Nevertheless, we are able to provide access to the dataset for valid purposes of
research and teaching.
Cleaning, structuring, and archiving the sermons corpus was naturally time- and
resource-consuming, insofar as manual assessment of the content and metadata
required considerable domain expertise. However, the process ensured thorough
insight into the quality of the material and enabled us to supplement the corpus with
finer-grained information. For example, we had defined most of the annotation tags
beforehand. However, during the process we had to construct further tags, such as a
tag to identify sermons not intended for the ELCD’s prescribed holiday services, e.g.
services in care homes or hospitals, or local events such as “hunting services” or
“Halloween services.”18 The cleaning process thus enabled us to construct a
structurally uniform text corpus, while remaining responsive to the received data in
the process.

Corpus statistics
Following the discussion above of the metadata associated with the corpus, this
section provides a brief breakdown of what we perceive to be some of the most
salient features of the corpus. In particular, we wish to draw attention to some of the

10

JOURNAL OF CULTURAL ANALYTICS

imbalances inherent in the corpus in its current format. This metadata can be broken
down into metadata related to the individual pastors and textual metadata generated
using corpus linguistic methods.
At the general level, the most pertinent corpus feature is the distribution of sermons
by year. A snapshot overview of this data can be found in Figure 1 below. There are
a number of things to be noted here. Firstly, this figure shows only those sermons
which come from the period 2011–2016. While this includes the vast majority of the
sermons in the corpus (96%), a small number of sermons fall outside of this time
period. Moreover, there is a very small number of sermons for which we have no
available year (roughly 0.2% of the full corpus).

Figure 1. Distribution of sermons by year

Within the distribution, we can see that there is a small imbalance in the data toward
later years, with 2015 being the year most represented. For the purposes of the case
study presented below, we have chosen to work with the full corpus of texts,
including those which lie outside the main 2011–2016 window and those for which
we do not have year data. This was in order to make the most of all available data
for the purposes of illustrating the analytical value of the corpus. For future studies,

11

SERMONS AS DATA: INTRODUCING A CORPUS OF 11,955 DANISH SERMONS

however, this discrepancy can be taken into account by focusing solely on sermons
from 2011–2016.
With regard to metadata related to individual pastors, one of the most relevant
features for further study is the distribution of sermons in the corpus relative to the
registered gender of the pastor. There is a noticeable imbalance in the corpus, with
the total number of sermons by female pastors being around 75% of the total number
of sermons by men (M=6,823; F=5,132). Grouping pastors by decade of birth creates
a more nuanced picture of the individuals behind the corpus. In Figure 2 below, we
see that men outnumber women across all birth decades with the exception of the
1950s. That is to say, there are more sermons by women born in the 1950s than men
born in the 1950s. A second point that is immediately clear is that the 1960s is by
far the most prominent birth decade for both genders. This is especially true for men,
however, with nearly as many sermons by men born in the 1960s (3,202) as men
from all other decades combined (3,621).

Figure 2. Distribution of sermons by pastors’ birth decade and gender

Alongside age and gender, the metadata also contains geographical information
relating to the diocese where the pastor and their church are located. A summary of
this geographical information can be seen in Figure 3 below. This summary reveals
that there are comparatively few sermons from those dioceses containing three of
12

JOURNAL OF CULTURAL ANALYTICS

the four largest cities in Denmark (Copenhagen, Aarhus, Aalborg). In this respect,
larger urban areas are not overrepresented in our corpus, relative to rural parishes. It
should be noted, though, that the label “diocese” is not necessarily an adequate
measure for distinguishing between urban and rural parishes. The diocese of
Copenhagen is the only diocese whose boundaries mostly correspond to the city
boundaries. In the dioceses of Aarhus and Aalborg, large surrounding areas outside
of the city boundaries also form part of the dioceses. Hence, as the label follows the
ELCD’s own geographical subdivision of the church, this metadata is important in
the study of whether content of sermons diverges according to pastors’ regional
affiliations.
As previously mentioned, the corpus content was collected on the basis of
opportunity sampling. The imbalances presented here were therefore expected and
do not diminish the relevance of the collection. For future research projects,
subsampling and balancing will still be possible owing to our well-structured
metadata.

Table 2. Linguistic measures in sermons for all pastors, female pastors and male pastors

The textual metadata about the sermons are general linguistic measures extracted
from the corpus using standard Natural Language Processing (NLP) measures. We
illustrate a number of these in Table 2 above.
The table presents four linguistic measures against the gender of the pastors, with a
third group “All” representing the full corpus. The measures themselves are fairly
uncomplicated, and include the average number of sentences per sermon, the
average number of words, the average Type-Token Ratio (TTR), and the average
Measure of Textual Lexical Diversity (MTLD).19 We find, generally speaking,
surprisingly little variation in these numbers relative to the gender of the pastor. The
largest difference would be that between numbers of sentences in sermons written
by women. However, this difference is somewhat offset by the fact that the average
number of words differs by only around 5% from the average number of words
written by men. Similarly, both TTR and MLTD seem to suggest that there is only
a small degree of variation between the genders in terms of lexical diversity.
Of course, the above methods of extracting information are somewhat crude NLP
measures of underlying textual phenomena. In the remaining sections of this article,
we present a case study of the kinds of research that can be conducted on this corpus
of sermons if more nuanced NLP methods are used alongside close-reading
approaches.

Case study: gender representations in sermons
Uncovering gender in text sources
In comparison with other text genres, sermons represent social worlds. Sermons
provide access to a distinct cultural context – preaching in the ELCD – in which

14

JOURNAL OF CULTURAL ANALYTICS

pastors represent social structures and engage in public discourses: an engagement
that unfolds both consciously and unconsciously. Susan Brown and Laura Mandell
argue similarly in an article on identity issues that literature is a window onto social
structures, social positions, and social change in culture, and that the representation
and construction of identities are underlying processes of literary writing. They
demonstrate, further, that computational analyses provide unique tools for
discovering the signifiers that mediate identities and their discursive constructs in
large text collections.20 These approaches have already shown immense potential for
the study of gender identities in regard to the social worlds of literary characters
portrayed by authors in the genre of literary fiction.21 We find that uncovering
similar structures in text productions by religious communities such as the ELCD
can provide valuable insights for the study of contemporary religion.
The ELCD is a liberal theological church and known in Denmark as “the inclusive
people’s church”22. However, there are no prominent threads in the ELCD of gender
oriented theologies, such as queer or feminist theologies, which is in contrast to other
similar church traditions, such as is found in Norway and Sweden. In fact, among
pastors in the ELCD, convictions can be found that an increasing feminization could
dilute the church23, or that gender is not interesting in a theological context24. A
qualitative study of twenty sermons investigated whether female and male pastors
differ in how they represent God and found that there were no significant
difference25. These perspectives indicate a tendency for pastors to frame the ELCD
as a rather gender-neutral space. This framing could resemble a more general attitude
in the Danish population. A survey from 2019 disclosed that 43% of Danes agreed
and 36% disagreed with the statement that the struggle for equality between genders
has gone too far26, suggesting that gender differences do not appear very topical in
the public discourse. Meanwhile, the Global Gender Gap report, which ranks
countries in terms of gender equality, shows that Denmark has moved from a fifth
place in 2014 down to a fourteenth place in 202027.
From a theological perspective, Else Marie Wiberg Pedersen has argued that the
reason why we do not see distinct feminist theological wings in the ELCD is not in
contrast to but because of the liberal theological framework of the church. She claims
that feminist theology is an inherent but unarticulated core component of the church
tradition, which has enabled, for example, an even distribution of male and female
15

SERMONS AS DATA: INTRODUCING A CORPUS OF 11,955 DANISH SERMONS

pastors28. In contrast, theologian Lone Fatum has argued that a consequence of
claiming gender equality and balance in the ELCD is overlooking gender
differences. She believes that such strategies cause gender blindness29.
In this section, we investigate whether a genre such as the Danish sermon is a genderneutral document. As there is no profound tradition for engaging with gender
theologies in the ELCD, we design our study as an investigation of how pastors
implicitly represent and discursively construct gender identities through their use of
third person pronouns. Gender theorist Judith Butler accentuated in her
performativity theory that pronouns can be considered to signify content insofar as
the structure of signification (the discursive context) in which they are embedded is
taken into account.30 If a consistent structure of signification appears around a
gendered pronoun, then a gendered identity can be inferred. In the case study below,
we study the signification structure surrounding male and female pronouns in the
sermons, while accounting for variations between male and female pastors. By
focusing on male and female pronouns in nominative compared with oblique
position and their associated verbs, we can learn general agency patterns for male
and female agents in the corpus. We acknowledge fully that this approach does not
allow us to venture into non-binary constructions of gender. However, as there is no
established Danish language practice for challenging these limits of language, this
approach is the best way of uncovering both conscious and unconscious
constructions of gender, inasmuch as we are able to work simply with the pastors’
use of everyday categories in language.
Methods
For this study, we combine distant and close-reading strategies. First, we extracted
raw text from each of the documents in the corpus. We then tagged the corpus for
parts of speech, and extracted collocations of gendered pronouns in either
nominative (Danish han and hun; English he and she) or oblique case (Danish ham
and hende; English him and her) as well as the verbs collocating with these pronouns
in their immediate sermon context. We did not include reflexive pronouns in this
study because, in contrast to English usage (himself, herself), the Danish reflexive
(sig) does not explicitly mark gender. Similarly, we chose not to lemmatize the
extracted verbs. This allowed us to distinguish between important grammatical
16

JOURNAL OF CULTURAL ANALYTICS

differences, such as tense and aspect, along with the use of active and passive
voice.31
This extraction process was repeated on two sub-corpora, one comprising sermons
by female pastors and another by male pastors. From these extracted collocations,
we calculated pointwise mutual information scores (PMI scores) for every pronoun–
verb collocation across each of the three sets of results. In order to filter the results
further, we kept only those verbs that appear more than ten times in sermons by male
and female pastors respectively. We then sorted the list by strength of PMI score,
which identifies the verbs most strongly associated with male and female nominative
singular pronouns (han and hun respectively). We refer to these results as our single
cases, insofar as they suggest the most important kinds of verbs assigned to men and
women individually. In addition, we identified verbs that were highly associated
with both male pronouns in nominative case and female pronouns in oblique case –
and vice versa – in order to represent the kind of actions that were most likely
performed by a subject toward an object of opposite gender. We call these types of
representations our relational cases.
Detecting gender representation through pronouns and verbs
We find that male and female pastors represent pronouns very similarly in terms of
raw frequency, but with a slight tendency for female pastors to represent female
agents more than male pastors do (see Table 3 below). This representation mirrors
the appearance of male and female characters in the two lectionaries that each
contains texts from both Old and New Testament. A recent numeration has shown
that in the first lectionary, 90.04% of the characters mentioned by name are male
characters, and the remaining 9.96% female. In the second lectionary, the difference
is smaller but still noticeable, with 20.2% of all characters mentioned by name being
female, compared to 79.8% male32. Though numbers in the sermons refer to
pronouns and numbers from the lectionaries refer to named entities, this finding
suggests that the character gallery of the biblical passages has a clear influence on
the characters represented in their sermons by male and female pastors alike.
Whether or not this means that pastors predominantly represent narratives with a
male protagonist (e.g. Jesus) and replicate the ancient social worlds of the biblical
sources, these numbers accentuate that the representation of gender in contemporary
17

SERMONS AS DATA: INTRODUCING A CORPUS OF 11,955 DANISH SERMONS

sermons is skewed. From this perspective, we see no break with biblical biases and
a direction toward a more equal representation of gender.

Table 3. Distribution of male and female pronouns in sermons by male and female pastors

However, by focusing on the discursive constructions of male and female characters,
we can obtain additional perspectives for understanding gender representations in
the sermons. We therefore performed an inductive coding of the two types of data
(single cases and relational cases) in the two datasets (male and female sermon
corpora). Here we find four meaningful analytical categories: active–competent
agency (verbs that express acts of vigor); cogitative–perceptive agency (verbs that
express acts of sensing and interpreting); communicative–expressive agency (verbs
that express extroverted or contact-oriented acts); and religious agency (verbs that
express acts connected to a religious context in particular). The full distribution of
analytical categories is shown in Tables 4a, 4b, 5a and 5b below33.

Table 5b. Distribution of analytical categories in sermons by women. The table presents verbs representative of one
of the four categories in relational cases.

Male and female agency in sermons
Tables 4a, 4b, 5a and 5b clearly illustrate how the prevalence of the four categories
differs between male and female pastors. The tables indicate that male pastors most
20

JOURNAL OF CULTURAL ANALYTICS

significantly represent male subjects as active–competent agents and female subjects
as cogitative–perceptive and communicative–expressive agents. Female pastors
seem more inclined to associate both genders with all agency types. Furthermore,
male pastors are more restricted in their use of verbs, whereas female pastors show
higher variation within the presented categories.
In the single cases, male and female pastors appear to represent male subjects quite
similarly in the category active–competent agency: that is, as capable and
independent agents. As mentioned, a similar full category does not appear for female
subjects as represented by male pastors. For male and female pastors alike, the most
significant verb according to PMI score for female subjects in the corpora is “gave
birth,” suggesting that an important role for female agents in the corpus is that of
mothers. In the relational cases, female pastors establish a relation between female
subjects and male objects with this verb, suggesting that they might reserve the
mother role for the Virgin Mary, mother of Jesus Christ. The same relationship is
not significant in sermons by male pastors, as they tend to associate the verb with
male as well as female objects (him and her).34 This observation may indicate that
male pastors focus more generically on female agents as mothers.
In the categories cogitative–perceptive agency and communicative–expressive
agency, female and male pastors associate rather similar verbs with female subjects;
male pastors, however, use verbs that are slightly more emotionally neutral. When
female pastors ascribe these types of agency to male subjects, they tend to use verbs
such as “decides,” “accepted,” “declare,” “asserted,” which may support the
independence and capability also found in the category of active–competent agency.
The category of religious agency is a small category of verbs which, as with
communicative–expressive agency, mainly indicate contact-oriented actions, but by
means of a vocabulary associated with biblical narratives. In sermons by male
pastors, the few verbs indicating religious agency do not imply a distinct male–
female relation, as there are no religious verbs represented in the relational cases,
only in the single cases. In contrast, this category is more demonstrable in sermons
by women, where the actions seem to mediate a relation between male and female
agents. The religiously related verbs seem to be closely linked to biblical characters.
“Preaching” and “healing” are actions strongly associated with Jesus in the gospels;
21

SERMONS AS DATA: INTRODUCING A CORPUS OF 11,955 DANISH SERMONS

whereas the story of the female sinner who washes and anoints Jesus’ feet (Luke 7:
36-38) seems to be lingering behind the close connection between female religious
agency and the word “anoint.” Thus, it seems that female pastors not only represent
religious actions with a bit more variety, but also tend to represent the agency of
biblical characters as more relational across genders.
In general, in sermons by men we find extremely few verbs that are significant for
both male agents in nominative case and female agents in oblique case – and none
that are representative of the four categories in the relational case “Female subject
and Male object”. The relational cases generally indicate that female pastors tend to
use verbs that establish links between genders. This finding seems to correspond
with the observation that female pastors are in all cases more inclined to include
verbs signaling communicative or interactional behavior.
Male and female language
The gender patterns found in the sermons corpus seem to mirror observations from
socio-linguistic research on male and female language users. To characterize
tendencies among female language users, Julia Wood and Deborah Tannen has
respectively proposed the terms “feminine speech community” and Deborah Tannen
the term “rapport talk”. Here, language users seek to establish contact and
connections between conversational partners as a strategy for maintaining
relationships by means of communicative acts expressing support, equality,
responsiveness, and tentativeness. In addition, Wood and Tannen find that male
language users often seek to establish distinctions between conversational partners
and to use language instrumentally to provide solutions for concrete objectives and
to signal status and independence. Here, language tends to be more direct and
assertive. Wood uses the term “masculine speech community” to conceptualize this
strategy, and Tannen characterizes it as “report talk”. Both Wood and Tannen
explain these strategies by different socialization processes typical for girls and boys,
while Wood emphasizes that any child, regardless of biological sex, can be
socialized into either of the speech communities35.
In our findings, male pastors seem to distinguish female and male agents in terms of
traits from feminine and masculine speech strategies cf. Wood and Tannen, with
22

JOURNAL OF CULTURAL ANALYTICS

communicative agency characteristic of female agents, and active agency associated
with male subjects. In contrast, female pastors appear to attribute active and
communicative agency to both genders in all cases; that is, female agents and male
agents share these traits, whereby the traits do not appear to be gender dependent in
sermons by women. We find a similar tendency when we look at the category
cogitative-perceptive agency: male pastors reserves this trait for female subjects;
whereas female pastors are likely to attribute it to male and female agents alike. In a
study on inward- versus outward-oriented behavior in classic nineteenth-century
novels, Andrew Piper demonstrates cogitative and perceptive behavior as prominent
traits of female main characters in novels by female authors. He argues that these
traits established a new type of subjectivity for female literary characters in this
period.36 In contrast, our analyses indicate that these traits are more likely to occur
as feminine in contemporary sermons by men, than in sermons by female pastors. In
general, female pastors seem to represent social worlds in which agents acquire both
female and male traits regardless of the gender of the pronoun, thus facilitating a
symmetrical social structure. In comparison, male pastors tend to provide an
asymmetrical structure when representing gender, by maintaining different traits for
female and male agents – a tendency that resembles aspects of report talk and
masculine speech communities. Therefore, this analysis illustrates that sermon
content is not gender neutral: male and female pastors differ in their use of
fundamental linguistic components, gendered pronouns and verbs, and thereby in
the actions they let characters perform. As such, they shape the social worlds of
sermons in quite different ways.
We acknowledge that pastors could use language to represent more diverse gender
identities than just male and female and that our approach does not capture such
constructions. Other methods would be more appropriate for exploring nuances to
such non-binary structures. Whereas the personal pronouns we have used are already
“pregendered” binary in language, extracting personal entities through Named Entity
Recognition would provide corpus characters that can potentially be constructed
more freely in language. This approach would enable us to study agency variations
of individual characters across the corpus. For example, whether the agency of God
would fit within a binary gender pattern or divert completely from such a structure.
However, before embarking on investigating possible deconstructions of binary
structures and more pluralized gender identities in a new and otherwise unknown
23

SERMONS AS DATA: INTRODUCING A CORPUS OF 11,955 DANISH SERMONS

corpus such as ours, we found it imperative first to investigate whether and how
binary gender structures exist in the corpus. Furthermore, our study indicates clearly
gendered differences in the context of the ELCD, where such topics tend to gain
rather little attention.

Conclusion
We hope that this article serves to accentuate the potential that large-scale sermon
studies can offer. Our contribution to this endeavor has been to sample, clean, and
archive a corpus of Danish church sermons that have never before been read. These
sermons constitute a collective text production containing in-depth cultural
information about the voice of a religious community. Our corpus is especially
noteworthy for the sampling and archiving approach adopted. We sampled the
sermon manuscripts directly from their authors as private documents that were not
necessarily intended for dissemination. One of the consequences of sampling
unedited sermons was that the pastors did not attain comparative structural
consistency in their documents, which convinced us to clean and annotate the
documents manually. While time-consuming, this approach allowed us to remain
responsive to the material and also to familiarize ourselves with it. This provided us
with an opportunity to gain insights into the quality of the material before
commencing data analyses.
One particular research challenge concerns the actual contents of the corpus. Given
that these are contemporary documents, written and spoken by living pastors and
often containing references to individual parishioners, they constitute potentially
sensitive data, with the consequence that the corpus cannot be fully open. We find it
commendable that communities within the computationally informed humanities
encourage initiatives to share data and provide open-access data. Constructing data
sets is both theoretically and methodologically fraught, not to mention timeconsuming, and barriers to access can also be a barrier to progress. However, it is
also necessary to promote the creation of data sets that do require restricted access.
We believe data sets such as ours can provide unique insights into living cultural
fields. Access to these fields, though, requires that we attend to the agents behind
the documents and to their incentives to provide data. In return, collecting data

24

JOURNAL OF CULTURAL ANALYTICS

directly from contemporary contributors and obtaining their consent allows
researchers to acquire full ownership of data.
We have included a case study in this article in order to illustrate the research
potential of the data set. We find that mentions of male and female characters by
female and male pastors are proportionally similar both to each other and to mentions
in the lectionaries. Nevertheless, we also find that representations of gender binaries
are more complicated when comparing tendencies in male and female sermon
corpora on a discursive level. The public voice of the ELCD is thus collective but
not “homophone”. The case study thereby demonstrates the value of combining
quantitative and more qualitative approaches to this new corpus, and it illustrates
that sermons are the outcomes of intricate dynamics between scripture, individual,
and society – dynamics that need to be investigated more thoroughly in the future.

During the process, we became aware that many pastors had also supplied extra material that we wished to
preserve separately for other projects. This consisted predominantly of prayers given just after the sermon and
pastoral speeches intended for other events (funerals, visits from schoolchildren). Both types of material contain
valuable information for the research questions we pursue. Our choice of a manual approach to cleaning and
archiving the sermons allowed us to realize that we had received much more cultural information than requested
from our informants.
