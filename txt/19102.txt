ABSTRACT
The absence of an exhaustive bibliography of novels published in the British Isles and Ireland during the 19th century
blocks several lines of research in sociologically­inclined literary history and book history. Without a detailed account
of novelistic production, it is difficult to characterize, for example, the population of individuals who pursued careers as
novelists. This paper contributes to efforts to develop such an account by estimating yearly rates of new novel publication
in the British Isles and Ireland between 1789 and 1919. This period witnessed, in aggregate, the publication of between
40,000 and 63,000 previously unpublished novels. The number of new novels published each year counts as essential
information for researchers interested in understanding the development of the text industry between 1789 and 1919.

Introduction
Aspirations in the 20th century for sociologically­inclined literary history found­
ered due to a lack of accessible, trustworthy, and inclusive bibliographies and
biographical records. Despite sustained interest, no principled estimates of the
number of novelists writing or the number of new novels published during the
19th and early 20th centuries ever materialized.1 Without a detailed accounting
of novelistic production, numerous questions proved impossible to answer. The
following three are representative: How many writers made careers as novelists,
Are there unacknowledged precursors or forgotten rivals to canonical authors,
To what extent is a writer’s critical or commercial success predictable from their
social origins? Although material traces of every novel published in Europe and
North America survive, gathering particulars required to answer questions such
as these proved too time­consuming or too resource­intensive.
The lack of credible information about the population of novelists and the popu­

lation of published novels obstructs research in literary studies, cultural studies,
book history, and sociology of literature. Two communities in particular stand
to gain from a more detailed accounting of these two populations. The first
includes those interested in studying literary form and prose style from below.
A characteristic concern of this group is an interest in how the emergence and
diffusion of literary morphology reveals information about broader economic,
social, and cultural relationships within and across national and linguistic sit­
uations (e.g., Escarpit, Moretti, Casanova, and Moretti2 ). The second group
includes researchers in cultural studies and sociology of culture interested in
uniting literary history with sociological concerns. This group includes those
interested in the working conditions facing novelists and those studying the his­
tory of occupational gender segregation in the text industry (e.g., Williams,3
Tuchman4 ). This group also includes those interested in reassembling an un­
derstanding of literary artworks as products of networks of actors whose actions
are necessary for works’ existence and whose actions, in turn, shape the art ob­
jects.5 Library digitization and sharing of machine­readable datasets are two
developments which support research agendas associated with these communi­
ties. More generally, these developments facilitate studying literary works at
multiple scales and with a broader range of vocabularies.
To demonstrate the improving prospects for data­intensive, sociologically­inclined
literary history—enabled by the availability of digital surrogates of surviving
volumes and the sharing of machine­readable bibliographic data— this paper es­
timates the yearly rates of new novel publication in the British Isles and Ireland
between 1789 and 1919. This period witnessed, in aggregate, the publication of
between 40,000 and 63,000 previously unpublished novels (“new novels”). Al­
though there has been considerable speculation about this time series, ours are
the first principled estimates to be published. The years studied include the rise
of mass literacy and one of the more important periods in the history of publish­
ing (1830­1850), a period during which practices and institutional arrangements
resembling the modern publishing industry emerge.6
The analysis presented here is limited to literary production on islands in the

North Atlantic. Although the prospect of comparative research was a primary
motivation for this work, a lack of comprehensive bibliographical records out­
side the British Isles and Ireland made such research difficult. The exhaustive
bibliography of novels published between 1770 and 1836 found in Raven and
Forster7 and Garside and Schöwerling8 (hereafter “RFGS”)—indispensable to
the work here—has no real equivalent. For example, although Brümmer9 is im­
pressive in the number of German­language titles it documents, like Block,10
it makes no claims to have enumerated all titles. Bibliographic work on nov­
els written in languages other than English is, however, ongoing and library
digitization makes the work easier. And the estimates presented here provide
information about plausible trajectories of literary production elsewhere. For
example, because it is hard to imagine per capita novelistic production growing
considerably faster than it did in the British Isles and Ireland during the 1840s,
the pace of growth during this decade may be used as an estimate of the upper
bound on the pace of growth in established text industries in other regions.

Rise of the text industry
No comprehensive survey of new novels published in the British Isles and Ire­
land exists for any year after 1836. There is neither an exhaustive list of new
novels published nor principled estimates of the number of new novels pub­
lished in any year after 1836. Given the pace of expansion in the publishing
industry during the period, and the time and resources required to complete
exhaustive surveys such as RFGS, this is understandable.11 The absence of
information about novels published after 1836 is regrettable because this pe­
riod witnesses the rise of mass literacy and sees the publishing industry adopt
practices and organizational structures characteristic of the modern text indus­
try.12 What little information we have about the population of literary works
published after 1836 relies on inferences drawn from the heterogeneous popu­
lation of published books (novels and non­novels, new and reissued).13 Even
here, however, the information is not detailed enough to allow us to estimate
the number of novels (new or reprinted), published during any year or decade.

REASSEMBLING THE ENGLISH NOVEL, 1789–1919

In this paper we estimate rates of novelistic production for each year between
1789 and 1919 from five existing data sources using a probabilistic model. This
model also allows us to describe our uncertainty about these estimated rates. In
addition to annual publication counts, the data permit us to estimate the pro­
portion of new titles associated with men and women authors. Although we
do not directly observe the number of new novels published in any year after
1836—or new novels by author gender after 1829—we infer credible intervals
through the use of a model of several correlated time series. Our results make
visible, for the first time, a period of particularly intense growth between 1840
and 1855.

Background
There are bibliographies and related resources that appear to provide informa­
tion about new novels published during specific periods of the 19th century.
Most are unusable. Typical are bibliographies of a period or novel subgenre
which for one reason or another are not exhaustive. Block14 is one example.
Although it advertises itself as a bibliography of English novels published be­
tween 1740 and 1850, it is not clear what novels are included and what novels
are missing. Worse, it includes books which are not novels by any prevailing
definition.15 There are, however, a small number of works which are exhaus­
tive for a period or genre and do provide information usable by those interested
in an inclusive history of the novel and of novel writing. Bassett,16 for exam­
ple, enumerates all three­volume editions appearing between 1863 and 1897.
RFGS, mentioned earlier, enumerates all novels published between 1770 and
1836. RFGS also helpfully makes clear how they go about the essential task of
distinguishing novels from non­novels.17
For those interested in an inventory of new novels published during the 19th cen­
tury, the most useful information comes from historians of publishing. With no­
table exceptions—including Escarpit and Moretti18 —literary historians work­
ing after 1950 have not pursued an inclusive history of the novel, one which
4

J O U R N A L O F C U LT U R A L A N A LY T I C S

would include all novels and novelists. Working with a machine­readable ver­
sion of the Nineteenth Century Short Title Catalog (NTSC), Eliot19 creates a
time series which provides information about the number of books published in
London, Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh, and Dublin each year between 1801
and 1870.20 Until an integrated history of the English novel and the book trade
is written, this series will be invaluable. It helps us in two specific ways. First,
it provides a crude upper bound on the number of new novels published each
year as the number of new novels will always be less than the number of books
(novels and non­novels) appearing in a given year. Second, because the rate of
book production and the rate of new novel production are correlated, the time
series gives us considerable insight into how the rate of new novel production
likely changed from year to year.
The two most important resources used to estimate the rate of novelistic pro­
duction are RFGS and a series derived from the Nineteenth­Century Short Title
Catalog (NSTC). Three other resources used in the model—which tend to cover
shorter periods—are introduced in the next section.

Method
We estimate annual rates of novelistic production from five data sources using
a probabilistic model. The model assumes that changes in the pace of novelistic
production are well described by exponential growth with transitory deviations.
Using the model and available data we infer the pace of growth and the character
of deviations. Taken together these inferences permit us to estimate the number
of novels published each year between 1789 and 1919. In this section we first
describe the resources used and then elaborate the model.

REASSEMBLING THE ENGLISH NOVEL, 1789–1919

Data
The English Novel, 1770­1836 (“RFGS”)

The most important source of information is The English Novel, an exhaustive
survey of novels appearing between 1770 and 1836.21 In this paper we refer to
the two­volume printed bibliography, updates, and online database collectively
as RFGS.22
RFGS anchors the analysis in this paper in several respects. What RFGS records,
counts of new novels—and, for 1800­1829, counts by author gender—is what
we wish to infer for the entire period (1789­1919). RFGS provides a principled,
descriptive definition of the novel: printed works referred to as novels by read­
ers at the time. The usefulness and specificity of this definition is amplified by
the fact that RFGS provides examples of works which meet the definition (the
bibliography itself) as well as works which do not meet the definition. RFGS in­
cludes detailed records for each title listed in the bibliography. For years 1800–
1829, each record includes an indication of the gender of the author. RFGS code
author gender as (“Male”,“Female”, “Unknown”). If the title indicates author
gender but not author name, then the title is associated with the indicated author
gender. For example, although the novel The Castle of Probation (1802) does
not have a named author, it is associated with a “Male” author in RFGS because
the novel’s full title includes the words “By a Clergyman”.23
As a practical matter, we see RFGS as providing two distinct time series: first,
counts of new novels published between 1770 and 1836; and, second, counts of
new novels by author gender between 1800 and 1829. We further limit our at­
tention to records associated with 1789 and later years in order to allay concerns
about the definitional strategy used. As the 18th century progresses, character­
istics associated with works labeled “novels” tend to stabilize. Works published
after 1789 which were referred to as novels are very likely to share morphology
with works labeled novels published during later decades. This is less often the
case for novels published earlier in the 18th century.

6

J O U R N A L O F C U LT U R A L A N A LY T I C S

To address the concern that the definition used by RFGS may be too restrictive,
that it may tend to exclude literary works which were not called novels but which
are, in all other respects, treated by readers at the time as if they were novels, it
is worth noting that different definitions of the novel tend to agree on particulars
in more than 85% of cases. Moreover, disagreement is localized. Most disputed
cases involve novel­like (didactic) juvenile fiction and novel­like religious fic­
tion.24 It should, therefore, be straightforward for other researchers to adjust the
estimates reported here or to modify the model source code accompanying this
paper to accommodate different assumptions about what works count as novels.
Nineteenth­Century Short Title Catalog (London, Oxford, Cambridge, Ed­
inburgh, or Dublin), 1801­1870 (“LOCED”).

Eliot25 extracts yearly totals of entries (novels and non­novels) listed in the
Nineteenth­Century Short Title Catalog (NSTC) associated with one of the fol­
lowing places of publication: London, Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh, or Dublin.
We refer to this time series using Eliot’s abbreviation, “LOCED”. Because RFGS
provide an exhaustive survey of new novels between 1801 and 1836, we know
what percentage of LOCED titles are new novels for 36 years. During these
years there is an opportunity to observe how the two time series covary.
Our LOCED series differs from Eliot’s in one important respect. The original
LOCED series has an unusual feature: undated material is assigned to the near­
est half­decade (to a year ending with a “0” or a “5”).26 To deal with this idiosyn­
crasy, we ignore entirely publication counts from the original series which are
associated with years ending in “0” or “5”. Although ignoring counts in these
years might appear to bias the counts associated with other years downward (as
many works, were their publication years known, “belong” in adjacent years),
we have a different view. The original LOCED series mixes two time series, a
series recording dated material and a series recording undated material. (New
novels, for example, are virtually certain to report publication years on their title
pages.) By stripping out counts for years ending with “0” or “5”, we ignore the
time series related to undated publications.27
7

REASSEMBLING THE ENGLISH NOVEL, 1789–1919

Publishers’ Circular, 1843­1919 (“PC”)

The third time series we use records yearly totals of new titles derived from
Publishers’ Circular, 1843–1919 (“PC”).28 Issues of Publishers’ Circular ap­
peared biweekly and listed new books published. The PC time series overlaps
with LOCED for 28 years (1843–1870), permitting observation of how these
two series covary. As one would expect given the similarity in what is being
recorded in the two series, the PC series and the LOCED series are highly cor­
related (r = 0.72). Together they give us a guide to year­to­year variation in
the rate of book publication over 119 years (1801–1919).
At this point the inference strategy may be growing clearer. We aim to gather
several partially overlapping time series which are correlated in order to “trian­
gulate” from observed rates to unobserved rates.
The Athenaeum Reviews of Novels, 1860, 1865, . . ., 1900

The fourth and fifth resources are used primarily to improve the estimates of
the number of new novels published after 1850. Improving our estimates for
this period is important because uncertainty grows as we move further away
from the bibliographic terra firma of the early 19th century. The fourth resource
appears in Casey.29 Casey provides counts for the number of novels reviewed in
The Athenaeum during nine years: 1860, 1865, 1870, 1875, 1880, 1885, 1890,
1895, and 1900. (The Athenaeum was a London literary magazine published
from 1828 to 1921.) Casey also breaks down the number of novels reviewed
during the nine years by author gender. We make the assumption that every
title counted as a novel in this time series meets the definition of a novel used
by RFGS.
Counts are taken from Chart 2 in Casey.30 In Casey’s series, titles with multi­
ple authors contribute an author fraction to the relevant count. As the model
used here is designed to model count data, all non­integer values in Chart 2 are
rounded down. As novels with multiple authors are exceedingly rare during the
period, we feel that ignoring authors other than the first will not meaningfully
8

J O U R N A L O F C U LT U R A L A N A LY T I C S

change any results presented in our analysis.
The Athenaeum does not review all novels published, so these counts are sig­
nificantly lower than the total number of new novels published. If we knew the
percentage of new novels reviewed by the magazine, we could derive the num­
ber of new novels published during these nine years. We infer the percentage of
novels reviewed by modeling the overlapping time series. This strategy is the
same as the one used to infer the percentage of total books published which are
novels. In our model, we assume that the percentage of novels reviewed, what­
ever it turns out to be, is fixed during the period 1860–1900. Supporting this
assumption is the observation that novel reviews in The Athenaeum increased
markedly between 1860 and 1900, suggesting that the periodical enjoyed flex­
ibility in the number of titles it reviewed.
Elicited distributions of new novel publications in 1886, 1891, and 1894

The fifth resource, like the fourth, is used to reduce the considerable uncertainty
about the number of new novels published in the second half of the 19th century.
The fifth resource is a series of three distributions over rates of new novels pub­
lication in the years 1886, 1891, and 1894. These distributions are elicited from
a domain expert, Troy Bassett, editor of At the Circulating Library: A Database
of Victorian Fiction, 1837­1901 (“ATCL”).31 We follow the elicitation proce­
dure described in Garthwaite, Kadane, and O’Hagan.32 For each year, we asked
Bassett to report quartiles of the distribution reflecting his beliefs about the total
number of new novels published that year. As editor of ATCL, a database which
contains entries for over 15,000 novels published between 1837 and 1901, Bas­
sett is in a position to make accurate estimates of intervals which are likely to
contain the total number of new novels published in any year during the Victo­
rian period. Eliciting quartiles of a distribution which describe the likely number
of new novels published in a year is roughly equivalent to asking for an interval
which contains the true number with probability 0.5. After eliciting quartiles of
the distributions for the three years, we find familiar probability distributions
which have quartiles as close as possible to those elicited. The three distribu­
9

REASSEMBLING THE ENGLISH NOVEL, 1789–1919

tions identified in this way are the distributions used in the model. For example,
the quartiles elicited for the year 1886 are 394, 482, and 613. A normal distri­
bution with mean 494 and standard deviation 163 has approximately the same
quartiles: 384, 494, 604.33

A model of novelistic production
In this section we review the most important assumptions we make in our model—
exponential growth with transitory deviations—and then describe in detail how
the five time series mentioned earlier appear in the full model. To simplify the
presentation, we initially describe the model without considering author gender.
The minor adjustments required to model author gender are presented at the end
of this section.
Seen from a distance, it is obvious that the rate at which new novels appear
grows exponentially. We can appreciate this by looking at the rate at which
books (novels and non­novels) appear.34 Additional evidence, if any is needed,
is available from Eliot35 which shows nonlinear growth in the number of titles
labeled as “Literature” in the NSTC.36 The standard approach to modeling this
sort of trend is a log­linear model. Taking log publication rates as our estimands,
we can describe the trend using a linearly increasing rate of publication. In a
log­linear model, the log rate of new novel publication in year t is described by
a two­parameter expression, α + βt, where β is interpreted as an annual growth
rate. (For example, if in year 1800 the annual rate of publication is 100 new
novels and the rate grows continuously at a rate of 3%, β would be 0.03 and
in the year 1900 the annual rate of publication would be roughly 2,000 new
novels.) In our model of the log rates of new novel publication, a linear trend
appears as the mean function of a Gaussian process.
Both the linear trend and transitory deviations are modeled by a Gaussian pro­
cess. A Gaussian process allows us model growth of new novel publication us­
ing a simple exponential trend while also permitting us to account for transitory
deviations from this trend due to disruptions in the book trade (e.g., economic
10

J O U R N A L O F C U LT U R A L A N A LY T I C S

depressions, wars, cholera outbreaks, and so forth). The time series derived
from the NSTC (LOCED) and Publishers’ Circular (PC) make clear that novel
publishing experienced several disruptions between 1789 and 1919. Time se­
ries of the number of books published suggest the influence of events including
wars, market panics, and epidemics. That the disruptions are transitory is also
clear. The text industry always returns to growth. Because Gaussian processes
can model both an underlying trend and transitory deviations, they are a familiar
choice in settings similar to this one. (As Gaussian processes are covered in de­
tail elsewhere—for example, in Rasmussen and Williams37 and Bishop38 —we
do not describe them in any detail here.) The backbone of our model is therefore
a Gaussian process of the log rate of new novel publication between 1800 and
1919. In symbols, the log rate of new novel appearance for year t = 1, . . . , 120
is given by

where the year t = 1 is associated with 1800, t = 2 with 1801, and so on.
GP(0, K) is a zero­mean Gaussian process with 120 × 120 covariance matrix K;
and the element (t, t′ ) of K is given by k(t, t′ ).
Two examples may help make the covariance matrix K more intelligible. K2,3
is the covariance between the observation(λ2 , the )log rate for 1801, and λ3 ,
2
. K2,120 is the covariance
the log rate for 1802. Its value is σλ2 exp − |2−3|

between the rate for 1801 and 1919. Unless(lλ is extremely
small, K2,120 will be

near zero because it contains the term exp − |2−120|
. (exp(−c) will be near
l2λ
zero whenever c is a large number.) A near­zero covariance makes sense here
because we do not anticipate an observation of the 1801 rate telling us anything
about 1919 rates.
2

11

REASSEMBLING THE ENGLISH NOVEL, 1789–1919

By learning the covariance function parameters σλ and lλ at the same time as
the deviations ⃗ϵ we learn how consistent the deviations are across time from the
data. In particular, σλ and lλ determine how much of the behavior of devia­
tions during early years constrains the behavior of deviations during later years,
helping us interpolate across gaps in the data.
To capture the belief that deviations from the trend will tend to persist for a
bounded number of years, we use an informative prior distribution on the char­
acteristic length­scale lλ . This distribution places 90% probability on values
between 1 and 10, expressing the prior belief that deviations will tend to per­
sist for between 1 and 10 years. Such a prior distribution is consistent with the
belief that, say, a market panic might affect the rate of novel publication in the
short term but would likely cease to influence publication rates in years which
are more than ten years distant from the event. Here, as elsewhere, we draw
on domain expertise to justify our modeling choices. Different choices will
lead to different results. (Different models—say, linear or quadratic rather than
log­linear—may lead to radically different results.) Readers who prefer differ­
ent assumptions are invited to edit the code which accompanies this article and
develop models which reflect their beliefs.
The observed annual counts of new novels from RFGS (1800­1836) (the first
time series) are connected to the latent log rates λ1:37 via a negative binomial
sampling distribution. This sampling model allows us to connect the smoothly
varying rates to observed counts of new novels. Separating the latent rate from
the observed counts in the model is particularly important before 1840 because
there is considerable year­to­year variation in the observed counts of new nov­
els. This variation is due to the arbitrary assignment of novel publications into
discrete years.39 In symbols, the sampling model is given for year t by
yt ∼ NegativeBinomial2 (exp(λt ), ϕy )

(4)

for t = 1, . . . , 37 where NegativeBinomial2 is parameterized by a location pa­
rameter and a parameter controlling dispersion. (If Y is distributed according to
2
a NegativeBinomial2 (µ, ϕ) distribution then E(Y) = µ and Var(Y) = µ + µϕ .)
12

J O U R N A L O F C U LT U R A L A N A LY T I C S

We use a two­parameter negative binomial sampling model here rather than a
simpler, single­parameter Poisson model. The former’s ability to model addi­
tional variation is important given the uncertainty about the latent process being
modeled.
To incorporate the counts of Publishers’ Circular (PC) titles (the second time
series), we introduce an additional Gaussian process to model, for each year,
the proportion of PC titles which are new novels. Background knowledge and
Eliot40 lead us to believe that the proportion will certainly be less than 50%
and that it will increase modestly over the period. As we did for the rates of
new novel appearance, we transform the proportions into units which are con­
veniently modeled using a linear trend. In this case, we express the proportions
on the log odds scale, denoting the log odds for year t as νt . (The log odds is
p
the logarithm of the odds, log( 1−p
), where p is a proportion between 0 and 1.)
In contrast to our thinking about year­to­year variation in rates of new novel
publication, we anticipate that the proportion of PC titles which are new novels
will change comparatively slowly. Whereas an economic crisis or other kind
of “shock” might affect the rate of new novel publication over a period of sev­
eral years, it would likely not affect the proportion of books which are novels.
In other words, we anticipate that factors influencing the economics of pub­
lishing novels as opposed to non­novels does not change as rapidly as factors
influencing the rate of book publishing in general. To capture this belief, the
characteristic length­scale for this second Gaussian process is modeled with a
prior distribution placing 90% probability on values between 8 and 36, express­
ing the belief that deviations from trend will tend to persist for between 8 and
36 years. In symbols, the proportions are modeled for year t = 1, . . . , 120 on
the log odds scale as follows:

As with the yearly novel publication counts, observations of PC title counts
(1843­1919) are connected to latent rates via a negative binomial sampling dis­
tribution. The latent rate of PC title appearance in year t, the mean of the sam­
pling distribution, is exp(λt )/ logit−1 (νt ), where logit−1 , the inverse logistic
function, is the inverse of the transformation of a proportion into log odds. For
example, if the proportion of PC titles which are novels is 12% and the rate of
new novel appearance is 300 then the observed PC title count will be modeled
with a negative binomial distribution with mean 2,500.
The yearly Nineteenth­Century Short Title Catalog (LOCED) publication counts
(the third time series) record similar information as the PC title counts series.
They both record total publications (novels and non­novels). They differ pri­
marily in the years they cover. The PC counts tend to be lower because PC tends
to only report editions for sale in London. Because these series are very similar,
we model the LOCED rate in terms of the PC rate. We assume that the LOCED
rate is a fixed multiple of the PC rate. The rate at which titles are recorded in
LOCED is incorporated into the model by assuming that the rate is the same as
the PC rate, multiplied by a constant factor, πν . Because LOCED counts are
always greater than PC counts, this factor will be greater than one.41 As be­
fore, a negative binomial sampling distribution connects this yearly rate to the
observed LOCED counts (1801­1870). For reasons discussed earlier, LOCED
counts from years which end in a ’0’ or ’5’ are ignored.
Counts of new novels reviewed in The Athenaeum (the fourth time series) are
incorporated into the model using a strategy similar to the one just described for
LOCED title counts. The rate at which novels are reviewed is assumed to be
14

J O U R N A L O F C U LT U R A L A N A LY T I C S

equal to the rate of new novel publication multiplied by a constant factor, πa .
The use of a constant factor reflects the assumption that the proportion of new
novels reviewed in The Athenaeum was roughly the same during each of the
nine years. As noted earlier, that The Athenaeum’s reviewing expands consid­
erably during the period (from 137 in 1860 to 473 in 1900) lends this assumption
superficial plausibility. As we know in advance that The Athenaeum does not
review all new novels, an informative Gamma prior distribution placing 90%
probability on a value between 30% and 70% is used. As with the other count­
based time series, a negative binomial sampling model is used to model the
relationship between latent rates and observed counts.
We connect the three distributions elicited from Bassett (the fifth data source)
directly to new novel publication log rates for the relevant years (λ87 , λ92 , and
λ94 ). This makes incorporating the distributions into the model straightforward:
the three elicited distributions are used as prior distributions on the rate of new
novel appearance during 1886, 1891, and 1894. Although a meticulous ap­
proach would associate the three distributions with the unobserved counts of
new novel publications—this is, after all, what Bassett was asked about—such
an approach would add considerably complexity to the model by requiring us to
model latent discrete variables (the unobserved counts). Assuming that the Bas­
sett estimates concern continuous latent rates rather than discrete counts has the
consequence of modestly understating the variance of the elicited distributions.
Given that the elicited distributions indicate a generous degree of uncertainty
we think this is a reasonable price to pay for a simpler model.
Modeling author gender

The essential structure of the model has been introduced. The full model differs
slightly from the version presented. In addition to estimating the number of new
novels published each year, the full model also estimates the number of novels
published by author gender. This is accomplished by adding, for each year, two
parameters to the model. The first parameter, ρt , records the proportion of new
novels associated with an author of unknown gender. The second parameter, σt ,
15

REASSEMBLING THE ENGLISH NOVEL, 1789–1919

records the proportion of known­author­gender new novels associated with men
authors (a proportion of a proportion). With these two parameters it is possible
to calculate the proportion of new titles given each of the three author gender
annotations. For example, new novels associated with women authors in year
t is given by (1 − ρt )(1 − σt ). Each sequence, ρ1:120 and σ1:120 , is modeled on
the log odds scale using Gaussian processes with a linear trend. Prior distri­
butions for the characteristic length­scale parameters are the same as the prior
distribution used for the length­scale parameter for the Gaussian process model
of ν1:120 (the proportion of PC titles which are new novels). Observed counts of
new titles by author gender—available in The Athenaeum series and, for 1800
to 1829, in RFGS—are modeled with negative binomial sampling distributions.
New novels by author gender, 1789­1799

We estimate the number of new novels by author gender separately for the 11
years between 1789 and 1799. Because the number of new novels published
during this period appears in RFGS, we need only estimate, for each year, the
proportion of novels associated with men, women, and unknown gender au­
thors. We accomplish this by collecting and manually annotating a random
sample of 110 titles from RFGS (ten titles for each year). For each year we cal­
culate a posterior distribution over proportions using a multinomial sampling
model and an informative Dirichlet prior distribution loosely centered on ob­
served proportions in 1800.
For the full model covering the period between 1800 and 1919, we estimate
model parameters using Markov Chain Monte Carlo.42 (For a general introduc­
tion to Monte Carlo methods in Bayesian statistics see Liu.43 ) All parameters
whose prior distributions are not discussed are given reasonable, weakly infor­
mative prior distributions.

New novel publications, 1789–1919
The model provides estimates of the rate of novel publications for each year
between 1789 and 1919. Figure 1 visualizes these rates. (Figure 2 shows these
rates normalized by population.) Each interval in Figure 1 shows the poste­
rior credible interval for the rate of new novel publication, exp(λt ), for a spe­
cific year t. Points represent the number of new novels published during 1789–
1836—a period for which we have exhaustive bibliographies. In aggregate be­
tween 40,000 and 63,000 new novels likely appeared between the years 1789
and 1919. (All intervals mentioned are 90% credible intervals.) A summary by
decade appears in Table 1. For comparison, the number of these titles which
are still in print today is shown, by author gender and decade of publication, in
Table 2. This “reprint canon” (borrowing the label from Bassett44 ) serves as an
approximation of the body of works currently taught in universities. The reprint
canon very likely represents less than one percent of novels published during
the period. It is possible that it represents as little as one half of one percent of
published titles.45
One remarkable development which is visible by inspection is the rapid growth
in new novel publication between 1840 and 1855. Figure 3 shows a plot of the
number of new novels published on a logarithmic scale. In this figure three
regimes of growth in the 19th century are visible. Before 1840 there appears to
be modest growth in the number of titles published each year. Between 1840
and 1855 there is rapid growth in the number of new titles produced. Average
annual growth during this period is 5%. Between 1855 and 1900 there is likely
steady, but markedly slower growth. The average annual growth during this pe­
riod is likely 2%. The rapid growth during the 1840–1855 period merits further
investigation. How did it come about and how was it sustained? What conse­
quences did it have for the network of actors involved in the literary market?
The rate of novel publication likely doubled in the space of a 15 year period,
requiring a rapid expansion in a range of processes of interest to literary histori­
ans and historians of publishing. For example, this growth suggests a doubling

of the labor of compositors, a doubling of paper used, and a doubling of the
rate at which manuscripts were developed for publication. How was this rate of
growth sustained? Did one particular novel subgenre, group of intermediaries,
or cohort of novelists benefit from this expansion? The rapid pace of growth
seems likely to have left traces in a variety of places, not least in the lives of
writers and in the morphology of literary texts.
Estimates of men authors’ share of new novel publication by year is shown in
Figure 4. The estimates are consistent with the widely held belief that there was
a demographic shift in the occupation of novel writing during the 19th century.47
At the beginning of the 19th century a majority of novels with known author
gender were associated with women novelists. By the end of the 19th century

this percentage had likely declined to roughly 40%.48 Within the expected sec­
ular decline in the proportion of novels associated with women authors there is
some evidence of a cyclical trend: the proportion of titles associated with men
authors declines during the 1860s and 1870s before recovering again.49
The estimates also permit us to say that it is virtually certain that novels by men
authors and novels first published in the 1860s are overrepresented among titles
which are still in print today. That is, the proportion of novels associated with
men authors in the reprint canon does not reflect the proportion of novels written
by men during the period. It is very likely that between 40% and 58% of novels
21

REASSEMBLING THE ENGLISH NOVEL, 1789–1919

written between 1789 and 1919 were associated with men authors (Table 1).
In the reprint canon, however, 71% of novels from this period are associated
with men authors (Table 2). The distribution of reprint canon titles by year
of first publication is also not aligned with the distribution of titles published
during the period. Titles published in the 1860s, in particular, appear to be
overrepresented in the reprint canon. Titles published in the 1900s appear to be
underrepresented. Although it is possible that the reprint canon does not reflect
literary works used in research and taught in university classrooms, the reprint
canon does reflect the population of 19th century novels which continue to be
sold and read.

Limitations and future work
The estimates presented here characterize uncertainty about the number of new
novels published between 1789 and 1919. The reduction is significant enough
that a variety of existing narratives of developments in the literary market and
the text industry merit revisiting in light of the new estimates. The account of­
fered by Tuchman50 of changes in the percentage of women pursuing careers as
novelists is one example. The census data Tuchman uses to gauge changes be­
tween 1861 and 1919 are, by her own admission, unreliable.51 Although the es­
timates presented here concern the annual number of titles published by author
gender and not the number of working women novelists, the series presented
here is more detailed and more relevant to the quantities of interest to Tuch­
man than any series available in the 1980s. Research on the social history of
novel writing similarly merits revisiting in light of these new estimates.52 New
research here would potentially complement any investigation into periods of
23

REASSEMBLING THE ENGLISH NOVEL, 1789–1919

particularly rapid growth in new novel publication (e.g., 1840–1855), as the
factors driving this expansion may be illuminated by studying the differences
between cohorts of writers before and after the expansion.
Although the estimates here give us greater confidence about the annual rates of
new novel publication, much work remains to be done. The estimated intervals
are wide, especially after 1850. Narrowing the intervals will require more pre­
cise information about novelistic production during the late 19th and early 20th
centuries. One simple, effective strategy for gathering such information would
involve conducting an exhaustive survey of novels published in a single year
after 1850. Because knowing the rate of production in a given year provides
information about plausible rates for neighboring years, accurate information
about a single year would improve estimates of neighboring years. Although
collecting an exhaustive list of novels published in, say, 1865 would be time­
consuming, the work itself is straightforward: new novels need to be identified
among all entries in Publishers’ Circular and the Nineteenth Century Short Title
Catalog for the chosen year.
The period of rapid growth between 1840 and 1855, if evidence for its existence
continues to accumulate, deserves further study. Did one or a small number of
factors drive this growth? Was the growth attributable to, for example, lower
per­unit costs arising out of technological changes (steam­powered presses and
paper­making) and internal industrial developments which lowered firms’ cost
of capital? Or, rather, was the growth attributable to an expansion in the number
of novel readers or intensification of novel reading among the existing popula­
tion of novel readers? The latter, at least, seems unlikely, because the gains of
the industrial revolution—which might have enabled more people to purchase
the luxury goods which novels and circulating library subscriptions unquestion­
ably were—did not accrue meaningfully to the broader population until after
1840.53

Conclusion
The number of new novels published each year counts as essential information
for researchers interested in understanding the text industry and print culture
between 1789 and 1919. Knowing that a novel was one among 100 (rather than
500) new works published in a given year affects how a researcher understands
the position of a work in the literary marketplace.54 Estimates of a variety of
quantities which have been the subject of scholarly attention can be bounded by
or estimated from the number of new novels published each year. Novels’ share
of all editions can be bounded from below given the number of first edition
novels and the number of works published in a given period. (The changing
share of prose fiction has been discussed in more than one scholarly study.55 ) A
second quantity of interest to book historians and social historians of literature
is the number of individuals who pursued careers as novelists.56 As the vast
majority of novels are written by one person, this quantity can be bounded from
above by the number of novels published during a given period. Equipped with
an estimate of the average number of novels published by a novelist during the
period, a serviceable estimate of the quantity itself could be calculated.
Reliable estimates of the number of new novels published each year help bib­
liographers assembling exhaustive lists of published novels. Such estimates
allow bibliographers to gauge their progress. For example, if a model such as
ours, one which draws together a range of sources, predicts that there are very
likely between 78 and 160 first edition women­authored novels published in
1865, a bibliographer can consult their list of titles to see if their total aligns
with the estimate. If the total in the bibliography falls conspicuously short of
the estimated total, this indicates that novels by women are missing from the
bibliography. In such a scenario, the bibliographer might then expand the range
of sources they are drawing on to identify novels. Absent such estimates it is dif­
ficult for a bibliographer to conveniently assess their progress towards attaining
an exhaustive list. Without estimates of the total, they must follow the expen­
sive and time­consuming approach of RFGS: make sure they have exhaustively

25

REASSEMBLING THE ENGLISH NOVEL, 1789–1919

reviewed all sources of information that could have recorded the publication of
a novel. Equipped with good estimates of the total number of published titles,
bibliographers can judge their progress at much lower cost.
Credible estimates of the share of new novels published each year by gender
allow literary studies scholars and book historians to assess how well arbitrary
collections of novels reflect the population. We have already mentioned a par­
ticular corpus, the “reprint canon,” which includes novels widely used in uni­
versity teaching and research. Our estimates allow us to compare the reprint
canon to the population of published novels. Another corpus of novels which
might be compared with the population is the collection of novels authored by
writers who are included in the Dictionary of National Bibliography (DNB). If
this corpus does not resemble the relevant population then it is unlikely that the
individuals in the DNB resemble the population of novelists. Knowing if the
DNB reflects the population of novelists would permit researchers to calibrate
their trust in existing studies which assume or suggest that writers in the DNB
resemble the population (e.g., Altick57 ).
The utility of the estimates presented here pales in comparison to the usefulness
of an exhaustive bibliography of the 40,000–63,000 new novels published be­
tween 1789 and 1919. The latter would allow us to say a great deal more about
the particular kinds of novels which were published and the range of writers and
publishers involved in the text industry. But an exhaustive bibliography of new
novels published in the British Isles and Ireland between 1789 and 1919 does
not exist and is unlikely to emerge in the next few years. In the interim, the es­
timates gathered here give researchers, bibliographers in particular, a series of
bearings which will allow them to better assess existing accounts of the history
of the novel and the history of the text industry.

There are many challenges associated with assembling an exhaustive list. A small number of books are pub­
lished but never advertised in industry publications such as Publishers’ Circular. In other cases, novels may be
advertised but never published, or published under a different title. Bibliographic work is further complicated by
the fact that in a very small number of cases, no copies of a novel survive.

in the relevant years. Lower bounds were available for these years because the ATCL database already contains
records for many thousands of novels published in the 19th century.

The distributions were elicited in a phone conversation between Allen Riddell and Troy Bassett on November
9th, 2015. The quartiles reported in the paper are discounted from the original quartiles (450, 550, 700). Dis­
counting is required because ATCL uses a more inclusive definition of the novel than RFGS. (For example, RFGS
exclude some religious and didactic fiction that ATCL includes.) Bassett reports that between 10% and 15% of
the novels included in ATCL would not be counted as novels according to RFGS. For this reason we discount
the reported quartiles by 12.5% (the midpoint between 10% and 15%). The matching of ideal distributions to the
elicited distributions (implied by the quartiles) involves one additional step because we model the rate of new novel
publication on the log scale. We use Gamma distributions which have quartiles as close as possible to the elicited
distributions (now on the log scale). For example, the final representation of the distribution with quartiles 394,
482, and 613 is (on the log scale) a Gamma distribution with shape and rate parameters of 278 and 46.

One way of appreciating the importance of modeling new novel publication with a continuous rate parameter
is to imagine a situation where the aleatory variation in new novel counts is considerably greater. Imagine modeling
new novel publication via weekly counts. In such a setting observing that zero new novels appeared in a given
week would not be particularly meaningful. It would certainly not imply that there was zero activity associated
with novel publishing during that week.

Counts derived from the NSTC and PC supply essential quantitative information about the development of
text industry in the British Isles and Ireland. In particular, these time series provide information about the year­to­
year variation in the number of editions produced by the text industry. These sources have been used in previous
research and are certain to be used in the future. While a precise understanding of their relationship is a topic for
another paper, we can offer some preliminary observations.
We know that for any given year the PC series always reports fewer editions than LOCED. The reason for
this is, we suspect, that PC tends to only report titles for sale in London. LOCED, by contrast, contains records

29

REASSEMBLING THE ENGLISH NOVEL, 1789–1919

for all editions which ended up in libraries. Since there was a legal deposit requirement and LOCED includes
records from the legal deposit libraries, LOCED covers a broader range of editions. LOCED gives us a sense of all
editions published in the British Isles and Ireland, not just those published or distributed in London. For example,
technical works published by university presses in Oxford, Cambridge, and Edinburgh which were not distributed
in London would likely appear in LOCED. These editions would tend not to appear in PC.
In our model we assume that, for every year, the number of editions in LOCED is a fixed multiple of the
number of editions in PC. We make this assumption because it simplifies the model and because we think it
is a reasonable assumption. It is a reasonable assumption if one believes that the rate of growth of publishing
outside of London grew at the same rate as publishing in London. The reasoning behind such a belief should be
familiar at this point. Technological changes in the text industry such as cheaper paper and cheaper printing shaped
publishing everywhere, not just in London. The same holds for relevant institutional changes, such as lower costs
of capital associated with maturing financial institutions. So the fixed multiple assumption rests on the belief that
the PC series captures the number of titles for sale in London and LOCED captures the number of titles published
in London as well as in publishing centers outside of London. If the rate of publishing grew at the same pace
throughout the British Isles and Ireland, the ratio of LOCED titles to PC titles should be approximately constant.

The period between 1800 and 1899 is often the focus of discussion. Between 21,000 and 28,000 appeared
between 1800 and 1899. Totals for other intervals may be calculated using annual publication rates shown in Table
3. Table 4 shows reprint canon titles by author gender and year.

Our estimates concern the characteristics of the population of new novel titles, not novelists. If one assumes
that novelist gender is uncorrelated with the number of novels they publish, then the share of novelists associated
with each gender should be roughly the same as the share of novels associated with each gender. Estimating the
demographic characteristics of the population of professional novelists should be addressed in subsequent research.
This research may need to, for example, avoid double­counting novelists who used different—or even collective—
pseudonyms.
49

Moretti (Graphs, Maps, Trees) suggests a connection between author gender and literary cycles during the
19th century. Moretti, however, does not appear to credit the possibility of a long­term secular decline in the
proportion of novels written by women authors (p. 27).

A reference point for this kind of research, in addition to Tuchman, is Williams (The Long Revolution). Past
