Shakespeare and Company and the American Library in Paris (ALP) have long
been represented as rivals. Yet the relationship between the two preeminent
American lending libraries in Paris—both of which opened their doors after
World War I as the city was becoming the heart of Anglophone modernist
literature—is more complicated. This article uses records from the Shakespeare
and Company lending library, historical newspapers, and the ALP’s annual Year
Book to reveal connections between the two institutions. The article asks us to
stop treating the libraries as rivals and understand them as complementary
nodes in the network of Paris’s interwar Anglophone community.

Gertrude Stein “was disappointed in me when I published Ulysses,” wrote
Sylvia Beach in her 1959 memoir; “she even came with Alice to my bookshop
to announce that they had transferred their membership to the American
Library on the Right Bank” (Shakespeare and Company 32). Stein’s
move—from Shakespeare and Company to the American Library in
Paris—has sustained the ongoing scholarly and popular representation of
the two libraries as rivals, framing membership as an act of allegiance. And
yet, the relationship between interwar Paris’s preeminent American lending
libraries—which both opened their doors to patrons immediately after World
War I, in a Paris that was becoming, but had not yet become, the heart of
Anglophone modernist literature—is clearly more complicated. The lending
libraries shared patrons and milieus, and when Beach had to give away
Shakespeare and Company’s books in 1951, she gave them to the American
Library, writing to its then-director, “I am glad to feel that the place for my
books now is the American Library of Paris” (Letters 223).
Records from Beach’s library, historical newspapers, and the annual Year
Book from the American Library in Paris (ALP) reveal connections between
1
the two libraries that transcend simple rivalry. In what follows, I trace the
representation of the two libraries in the periodical press; compare their
patrons’ locations and borrowing habits; and examine the tastes of
Anglophone readers in Paris against Americans in the US. Modernist studies

has increasingly replaced the model of the genius working in isolation with
2
the idea of collaborative networks. This essay asks that we extend our
understanding of this cooperative atmosphere beyond individuals to
institutions, retelling the story of Shakespeare and Company and the
American Library in Paris to emphasize their similarities (and symbioses)
alongside their differences.

Rivals or Peers?
Sylvia Beach herself seeded the idea that Shakespeare and Company and the
ALP were in competition nearly as soon as her bookshop opened its doors.
Writing to her mother in 1920, as the ALP struggled to sustain itself after its
war-time financial support from the American Library Association expired,
Beach reported “Miss Gertrude Stein says the great American Library rue de
l’Élysé e is going to fail for lack of funds she thinks, and I hope so I’m sure.
3
It’ll be a glad day and hurrah for it” (Letter, in Wang 151). Decades later,
this narrative of a rivalry was cemented in both Shari Benstock’s and Noël
Riley Fitch’s influential 1980s accounts of the Left Bank’s women. Despite
little evidence beyond Beach’s comment to her mother to support it, this
antagonistic framing has continued in contemporary scholarship: in 2014,
even as historian Nancy L. Green acknowledged that the ALP was “of course
not in direct competition with Shakespeare and Company,” she referred to
the two bookstores as “rivals” and made much of their disparate memberships
(38).
The local press emphasized the differences between the two institutions from
their earliest years. In the “Paris American” newspapers—most prominently
the editions of The New York Herald and The Chicago Tribune produced
and published in the European city—Beach’s library was represented as the
haunt of artists and intellectuals, while the ALP was described in prosaic
terms. A 1921 Paris Tribune article titled “Literary Adventurer” introduced
Beach to the paper’s readers as “a Maecenas for Paris writers, poets, and
bookworms,” likening her to Rome’s most famous patron for the arts, while
the Tribune’s reporting on the ALP focused on its quotidian operations, such
as fundraisers, holiday closures, and membership costs (3). These differing
depictions of the two lending libraries—one a site for adventure, the other a
familiar comfort—remain evident in the 1929 travel guide Paris Is a Woman’s
Town, where Beach’s bookshop is described as “a meeting place for young
intellectuals and older ones too,” and the ALP is seen as “a cozy home-like
place to browse about in on dour days” (188, 167).

2 Among the many texts to develop the ideas of modernist collaboration and networks are Davidson; Gifford; and ed. Southworth.
3 The American Library launched as part of the Library War Service, funded by the American Library Association, in 1918, and transitioned

to an independent institution in 1920. See Bone and Thompson.

Despite their different reputations, the libraries shared many characteristics.
Both were founded by Americans with the aim of serving Paris’s Anglophone
residents and the French; both operated on slim margins, privileging readers
and books over profits; both charged similar rates for borrowing privileges
and allowed visitors to read on-site without paying anything; and both sought
to create appealing spaces in a city still recovering from the First World
4
War. This attention to creature-comforts was on display when, just a week
after opening, Beach wrote to her mother, “you needn’t be afraid of my
freezing or anything—the little stove filled with ARC coal heats the place
till the guests and myself are fairly red in the face” (Letter, in Wang 143).
Around the same time, a reader of the Paris Herald celebrated that, at the
American Library, “at this time when coal is so expensive, there are glowing
5
fireplaces where warmth and cheer thaw the heart” (Ward 2). These shared
features meant that both libraries emerged as hubs of community connection
6
as Paris’s American population swelled in the interwar years.
The most concrete distinction between the two institutions was their size.
Beach described her shop—a former laundry—as “two rooms, with a glass
door between them, and steps leading into the one at the back” (Shakespeare
and Company 17), while the dramatically larger American Library was, in
its early years, spread over three floors of a “beautiful old hotel” (“Some
Facts” 201). The differing scales of these physical spaces was matched by their
membership numbers and holdings. In 1926, during the population peak
of Paris’s American colony, the ALP claimed 4387 cardholders, while the
Shakespeare and Company Project (SCP) records only 249 members at Beach’s
7
library (fig. 1). That year, the ALP reported 37,071 circulating works, while,
in contrast, the SCP data has identified around 6,000 titles available for loan
8
during Shakespeare and Company’s twenty-plus-year existence (1919–1941).
While Shakespeare and Company, thanks to its intimate connections to the
era’s most famous writers, is the Paris-American library that has attracted the
most attention, these differences in size and scale are reminders that Beach’s
library represented just a fraction of the city’s exchange of English-language
9
books.

4 For more on joining Beach’s library, see Kotin, “Becoming a Member.” ALP membership costs are available in ALP Year Book 1923, 36.
5 I have written about the ALP’s interior and its history in “‘Essentially an American Institution’” (207–225).
6 At its peak in the late 1920s, there were at least 40,000 Americans living in Paris. Green discusses the difficulty of obtaining an accurate

count, given the transience of the community and discrepancies between American and French government records (Other Americans 17).
7 Based on the Year Book data, 1925 and 1926 represent dramatic highs in the number of those borrowing books from the ALP, although it is

unclear how consistent the library’s methods of tallying users were across years. The Year Book report 3697 cardholders in 1921, 3500 in
1922, 2270 in 1923, 2781 in 1924, 4678 in 1925, 4387 in 1926, somewhere between 1825 and 3110 borrowers in 1927, up to 3404
members in 1928, and 3402 for 1929 (see ALP Year Book 1922, 1923, 1924, 1925, 1926, 1927, 1928, 1929, 1930*); Kotin and Koeser, “Data
Sets” 4.
8 The ALP figure comes from ALP Year Book 1927, 42.
9 In addition to many personal lending libraries—such as those of Nancy Cunard and Ada “Bricktop” Smith—the other prominent

Anglophone bookshops and lending libraries in the city during the period were Galignani Library, Brentano’s, and W. H. Smith and Son.

Who Belonged Where?
The membership rolls of the two libraries provide a site to consider their
complementarity. Although the ALP was the significantly larger institution,
it is Shakespeare and Company that has left the more detailed records. The
SCP considers their list of the lending library’s members—totaling about
5,235 individuals between 1919 and 1941 and compiled from borrowing
cards and Beach’s logbooks—“near-complete” (Kotin and Koeser, “Data
Sets” 10). The ALP’s records, on the other hand, supply the names of
only around ten percent of the Library’s borrowers, via their published
10
annual reports on members and patrons (fig. 2). These reports contain the
names of the 300–400 individuals who paid for a formal membership at the
library each year: leaving out monthly and bi-annual subscribers; students
and teachers for whom a borrowing card was free; the staff of the many
American organizations with company memberships; and all those who used
11
the reading rooms without borrowing privileges.
Despite the incomplete data, there is value in comparing these two
institutions’ member lists. A comparison of names across the American
Library and Shakespeare and Company’s membership rolls reveals that, out

10 For example, the ALP claimed as many as 3404 members in 1928 but named only 391 of them in the Year Book; see ALP Year Book 1929,

27, 44, 79–86.
11 In 1922, memberships were priced at the following rates: to be a “Patron,” one had to give at least Fr5,000; to be a “Life Member,” Fr2000;

for an annual membership, a one-time Fr100 fee, plus an additional Fr100 per year. See ALP Year Book 1922, 29.

of over 900 members identified by the ALP in the 1920s and the more than
12
5,200 on the SCP’s spreadsheet, there are just thirty definite crossovers. This
would suggest wild differences in the institutions’ memberships, were one
not aware of the partiality of the ALP information. The fact that there are
any overlaps means we can surmise that a fuller picture of the ALP would
reveal many more people who borrowed from both libraries. This conjecture,
reduced to the numeric, suggests that if just ten percent of known names
from the American Library yield thirty overlaps, we might expect closer to
300 repeated names if the ALP’s full list of borrowers was available.
The short list of coinciding members challenges the idea that Paris’s
American community generally regarded the libraries as rivals. Two names
that appear on both lists belong to members of the ALP’s governing bodies:
the Comtesse de Chambrun—née Clara Eleanor Longworth in Cincinnati,
Ohio—was a Shakespeare and Company member in 1923 and 1924, as well
as being one of the ALP’s most stalwart supporters from its inception; and
George Fleurot, who belonged to Beach’s library in 1926, was a member
of the ALP’s Committee on Ways and Means in 1924. If belonging to
one library was a blow to the other, it seems unlikely there would be this
reciprocity among the ALP’s leaders.

12 About twice that number of names lack enough specificity to determine if they correspond.

There are insights to be gathered from the absences in the ALP’s records.
Take, for instance, the case of Ernest Hemingway, who does not appear on
the American Library’s available membership lists and was known to be an
early, passionate supporter of Shakespeare and Company. If one subscribes
to the idea that the libraries were rivals, one might assume that Hemingway
aligned himself with Beach over the ALP. Yet Hemingway was friends with
the ALP’s director W. Dawson Johnston, asserting in 1925 that “Dr Johnston
is a priceless bird and his wife is the genuwind [sic]. . . . We are very fond
of them” (Letters 2: 227). Hemingway also demonstrated his support for the
ALP by publishing two book reviews in the American Library’s publications
(Review, Chicago Tribune; Review, Ex Libris). If one of interwar Paris’s most
storied writers is an unrecorded supporter of the ALP, there are likely many
13
other familiar names absent from the ALP’s records.
“DAMN the right bank pigs” Ezra Pound wrote to Beach when he read a
report in the Paris Herald that the American Library had banned an issue
14
of H. L. Mencken’s American Mercury (quoted in Fitch 62). This response
reflects a common desire to imagine the divide between the libraries along
geographic lines—with the artistic Left Bank patronizing Beach, and the
15
prosaic Right Bank visiting the ALP. This is a distinction between the
libraries’ members that is, to an extent, supported by the data. The SCP’s
analysis of Beach’s membership shows that “the majority of the members of
the Shakespeare and Company lending library lived on the Left Bank,” while
in 1926 the ALP reported that only “3 per cent” of members lived “on the
south [Left] side of the river” (McCarthy and de Sá Pereira; ALP Year Book
1926 29). But since Beach’s library was located on the Left Bank, and the
ALP on the Right, might this simply be a matter of convenience for patrons,
rather than a declaration of loyalty? The idea of an artistic/prosaic divide that
conformed to geographic lines is challenged by the SCP’s data, which shows
Right Bank addresses for members including F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald,
Paul Valéry, Archibald and Ada MacLeish, and even James Joyce. The ability
to access Anglophone literature from various places in the city likely made
both libraries attractive to readers from across Paris (McCarthy and de Sá
Pereira).

13 Famed artists and writers whose names do appear on the ALP’s membership roles include Stein; Edith Wharton, a longtime supporter and

sometime board member at the ALP; the sculptor Janet Scudder; the writer John Peale Bishop; the novelist Louis Bromfield; the French
essayist and critic Charles du Bos; and the arts patron Otto Kahn.
14 Pound is responding to a report in the Herald from April 27, 1926 that said that the issue containing Mencken’s censored “Hatrack” had

been banned by the library. This report was retracted in the following day’s paper, with the director, Burton Stevenson, clarifying that it was
simply being kept at the magazine room’s desk to prevent theft (“‘American Mercury’”).
15 Benstock explores this division between the Seine’s banks extensively; see especially Women 34–35.

What Did People Read?
In addition to comparing the two libraries’ memberships, we can look at
the data to provide a glimpse of members’ borrowing habits. The SCP has
produced a dataset from the borrowing records for Beach’s lending library,
although it has limitations: Beach preserved the lending library cards of 654
members, a fraction of Shakespeare and Company’s total users (Kotin and
Koeser, “Data Sets” 6). Once again, information from the ALP is even more
limited: patrons’ borrowing can only be compiled from irregular, narrative
16
reports that librarians provided to local newspapers.
Yet even this partial picture provides insight into the similarities and
differences between reading choices at the two libraries, and allows these
Anglophone Parisians’ tastes to be contrasted with readers’ selections in
the United States. In what follows, I will compare reading habits across
the libraries at three moments: on or about 1922, that annus mirabilis of
modernist literature; 1927, while Paris’s American colony was at its interwar
peak; and 1930–31, when the effects of the Depression were beginning to be
felt, and many Americans were returning to the US.
To begin with the first of these periods: the early 1920s, not long after
the launch of both libraries. The most granular data for borrowing at the
American Library comes from January through March of 1922, when the
Library began producing weekly columns for the Paris Herald and the Paris
17
Tribune, which featured lists of popular titles. This short-lived snapshot
reveals that patrons were eager to read A. S. M. Hutchinson’s If Winter
Comes (1921); John Dos Passos’s Three Soldiers (1921); the final novel in John
Galsworthy’s Forsyte Saga, To Let (1921); Lytton Strachey’s Queen Victoria
(1921); Frederick O’Brien’s travelog Mystic Isles of the South Seas (1921); and
H. G. Wells’s account of post-World War I diplomacy, Washington and the
Hope of Peace (1922) (New York Herald, “Latest Library Additions” 2).
How do these titles compare to those read by Beach’s members, and to
readers in the US? Some were popular across both Paris libraries—the
Galsworthy, Strachey, and Wells books were borrowed repeatedly from
Shakespeare and Company in 1922. Some, however, were not: the SCP
records do not report copies of either Hutchinson’s or O’Brien’s books at
Beach’s shop. The data for Dos Passos’s Three Soldiers is more ambiguous:
Beach’s library does not have any loan events recorded until 1926, which
might suggest a lack of interest among her members, or that the membership
cards showing its circulation are among the many no longer extant, or that

16 Although individual titles are absent from the ALP’s year books, beginning in 1926 they provide numeric details on borrowing in the

following genre categories: general, philosophy/religion, sociology, literature, history, travel, biography, language, science, useful arts, fine arts,
fiction, rental, periodicals, juvenile. See ALP Year Book 1926, 29–30.
17 These columns continued through the 1920s and into the 1930s, but the lists of popular books for the week were short-lived.

she did not acquire a copy until later. In the US, the Hutchinson, Strachey,
and O’Brien books all appear on the Publisher’s Weekly bestseller lists in 1921
or 1922, but the Galsworthy, Dos Passos, and Wells do not (a different Wells
work, The Outline of History [1920] is on the lists, hence his appearance on
18
figure 3). Strachey’s biography, Queen Victoria, is the only title the data
shows to be popular at all three sites (fig. 3).
Many of the works on the Publisher’s Weekly lists of popular content in
the US were not held by Beach’s library at all, nor were they mentioned
by the ALP’s librarians: reading choices of Americans in the US clearly
19
differed from those of visitors to the lending libraries abroad. One book
with a particularly notable contrast between its popularity in Paris in the early
1920s and in the US was Edith M. Hull’s romance, The Sheik (1919). Frank
Luther Mott’s Golden Multitudes (1947)—which identifies bestselling books
by their cumulative sales figures by 1947—names The Sheik as the only book
published in the US in 1921 to have sold over a million copies, and it appears
20
on the Publisher’s Weekly lists in both 1921 and 1922 (313). However, the
weekly reports on popular titles at the American Library in early 1922—when
sales of The Sheik were soaring in the US—do not mention it, and only one

borrow is recorded for the book at Shakespeare and Company in 1921. This
single borrow, though, confounds any neat divide between modernist and
middlebrow taste at the libraries: the borrower of The Sheik was none other
than Gertrude Stein!
Jumping ahead to 1927, evidence shows that the preferences of readers
at the two libraries in Paris had more in common with each other than
with readers in the US. A headline in the Paris Herald reflecting on 1927’s
borrowing habits declared “Love Story Passé; Paris’s Americans Demand
Modern Detective Yarn,” naming British writers J. S. Fletcher, E. Phillips
Oppenheim, and Edgar Wallace as the ALP’s most popular mystery authors
(2). Beach’s records, too, show that these writers were popular: she held
twenty titles by Fletcher, twelve by Oppenheim, and ten by Wallace. But in
the late 1920s, none of these authors appeared on the Publisher’s Weekly
lists, nor among Mott’s top cumulative sales figures. Detective fiction simply
did not dominate the US bestseller lists of the period. And it wasn’t only
detective fiction indicating that borrowers in Paris had preferences distinct
from those in the US: the Herald article also names Theodore Dreiser’s realist
An American Tragedy (1925) and Rosamond Lehmann’s romance Dusty
Answer (1927) as popular at the library (“Love Story Passé” 2). Both books
were frequently borrowed from Shakespeare and Company as well that year,
yet neither appeared on American bestseller lists.
The third snapshot of borrowers’ tastes—the early 1930s—supplies
additional evidence of a division between readers in Paris and those in the US.
In 1930, ALP librarian Margaret Carmichael told the Herald that “American,
French and English residents preferred books by Theodore Dreiser, Sherwood
Anderson and Sinclair Lewis, with Joseph Hergesheimer running a close
fourth…the library finds the following contemporary authors enjoy wide
circulation: Edith Wharton, Willa Cather, Margaret Deland, Hugh Walpole,
Katherine Mansfield, and Edna Ferber” (“U. S. Tourists Scorn Fiction” 5).
All of these authors were popular at Beach’s bookshop, with her library
holding multiple titles by each of them. But in the US, there is no such
overlap. Of these ten names, half (Lewis, Walpole, Wharton, Cather, and
Ferber) produced American best sellers, while the other five (Mansfield,
Dreiser, Anderson, Hergesheimer, and Deland) never made appearances on
the Publisher’s Weekly lists.
As discussed, the differences between Shakespeare and Company and the
ALP in the popular narrative of the two libraries are framed largely through
their associations with modernist and middlebrow literature, respectively.
Therefore, I would like to say a bit more about what this article’s sources

21

reveal on this front. In her memoir, Beach explained that she opened her
library in Paris because “our moderns . . . were luxuries the French and
my Left Bankers were not able to afford” (Shakespeare and Company 21).
The ALP, on the other hand, professed no such commitment to modern
literature, and the data from the two libraries’ earliest years reflects these
different priorities. Figure 3, the diagram of popular authors in 1921 and
1922, includes Virginia Woolf, D. H. Lawrence, Michael Arlen, Richard
Aldington, and Carl Van Vechten at Beach’s bookshop—all of whom are
absent from the other lists during this period. But as the 1920s progressed,
Shakespeare and Company’s distinction as the sole source for modernist
texts in English diminishes: a 1931 Paris Herald headline about the ALP
declared: “Readers Here Have ‘Highbrow’ Tastes” (5). As proof, the article
cites popular titles that include Radclyffe Hall’s The Well of Loneliness (1928)
and Gertrude Stein’s Lucy Church Amiably (1930). Joyce—already, of course,
popular at Beach’s bookshop—is also included on this 1931 list from the
ALP. Although the two libraries may have started by appealing to different
clienteles, it appears that, by the 1930s, readers at both libraries in Paris had
catholic reading habits across genres, with signs of more overlap between
readers in Paris than with their compatriots at home.

Conclusion
In The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas (1933) the fictionalized Toklas reports
that she and Stein first joined Beach’s library because “there was the American
Library which supplied us a little, but Gertrude Stein wanted more. We
investigated and we found Sylvia Beach” (195). I would like to linger on this
word “more,” which seems aberrant when describing a lending library with
a fraction of the members and the holdings of the ALP. What if, instead
of telling a story of the libraries vying for Toklas’s and Stein’s favor, we
read this “more” to suggest the two libraries complemented each other, and
that, together, they provided more reading opportunities to Paris’s interwar
Americans? The importance of Shakespeare and Company to the story of
modernist literature and expatriate Paris is already established. Understanding
Beach’s library in relation to the ALP can broaden our understanding of the
era, and what these individual institutions gave to it.
How does the data from the SCP and the ALP help us better understand
the relationship between the two libraries? Alongside contextual historical
materials, including newspapers and reports on US book sales, it complicates
neat divisions between the two libraries and diminishes an unexamined
narrative of rivalry. We see overlaps in the two libraries’ membership lists, and

21 For the purposes of this piece, I am more interested in whether an author’s reputation in contemporary scholarship groups them into one of

these categories than I am in formal definitions of modernism and the middlebrow. For more on modernism and the middlebrow, see

University Press, 2003); Lise Jaillant, Modernism, Middlebrow and the Literary Canon: The Modern Library Series, 1917–1955 (London:
Pickering and Chatto, 2014).

evidence of patrons who lent their ardent support to both institutions. The
data suggests that while, upon founding, Beach’s library may have offered
more modernist literature than the ALP, as time progressed members at
both libraries became interested in popular and avant-garde writing, and that
readers in Paris had more in common with each other than with readers in
the US. The data confirms that while the Left and Right bank affiliations
of the two libraries have geographic merit, they lack a clear aesthetic divide.
Let us stop telling a story of these two libraries as rivals, and instead better
understand them as complementary nodes in the network of Paris’s interwar
Anglophone community.
