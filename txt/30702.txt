ABSTRACT
The guidelines presented here were developed in a seminar aimed at M.A. and advanced B.A. students. They are based on
narratological theories by Marie-Laure Ryan, Gérard Genette, William Nelles, Ansgar Nünning, John Pier, and Viveca Füredy.
Our contribution focuses on how collaborative annotation tasks can be used in university seminars, especially in the context of
teaching students how to critically assess and compare theoretical frameworks and definitions. We also highlight the students’
impression that developing and using annotating guidelines improved their close-reading skills and that the task sensitised
them to some of the core challenges of distant reading (e.g. questions of ambiguity and interpretation).

Preliminary Remarks
These guidelines were developed in our seminar “Digital Methods in Literary Studies”, which was aimed at M.A. students and advanced B.A. students. At the beginning of the seminar, students were introduced to the aims and challenges of
digital annotating in general as well as to different narratological theories (including Genette, Ryan, Nelles, and Füredy). Due to its narratologically challenging
nature, Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein was chosen as a text against which we could
test our guidelines and which triggered their modification.
One problem we debated in class was how to annotate in the first place: should
we only annotate the place in which the change occurs, e.g. the point between two
different narrative levels, or should we annotate the whole passage belonging on
one level? In the end, we decided to use the former option, i.e. to annotate the
point in-between two contrasting passages.
The in-class discussions soon drew our attention to fundamental problems that
arise when trying to transform vague or even contradictory narratological theories into unambiguous, widely applicable annotation categories. The first issue
was the definition of narrative itself. In particular, when does a dialogue, which
is part of a narrative, become a narrative of its own? For example, is the statement
“I went to the supermarket and bought some fruit” already a narrative? As a simple
working definition we decided to choose “a report of connected events”1 . This is
important because, for example, Marie-Laure Ryan has an even wider definition,2
which leads, as we think, to obscuring matters by a proliferation of narratives. The
example, however, indicates a wider problem: there needs to be a clearly defined
research question before starting to define and annotate narrative levels. For example, when one wants to find out whether novels from the eighteenth century tend
to have more embedded narratives than twentieth-century novels, using annotation guidelines that are primarily based on Ryan’s theory (see Change of narrative
141

C O L L A B O R AT I V E A N N O TAT I O N A S A T E A C H I N G T O O L

levels (Genette) and Change of narrated worlds below) might distort one’s results
because the crossing of an illocutionary or an ontological boundary does not necessarily establish an embedded narrative. Hence, even within the field of embedded
narrative, there is no such thing as a ‘universally marked-up text’ that has to be
annotated once and then can be re-used for many different research purposes.
The discussion of Frankenstein alerted us to another problem, namely the question
of who, actually, is the narrator in a given passage: in the novel, Walton does
not hear the Creature relate its own story; instead, it is filtered through Frankenstein. Who, then, is the narrator of the passages concerning the early life of the
Creature? The Creature who related them to Victor, Victor who tells them to Walton (and maybe slightly manipulates them), or Walton who writes them down (and
maybe does not transcribe Victor’s tale verbatim)? For the sake of simplicity, we
decided to go for the original source and assumed that the Creature is the most
relevant narrator of its own tale. The aspect of time (e.g. whether a certain part
of the narrative occurs in a prolepsis) also had to be discarded since otherwise our
guidelines would have become too complex. Furthermore, when contemplating
how to annotate two narrative levels that describe different worlds, we decided
not to use separate tags for dreams, beliefs, delusions, and the like. This would
have led to a proliferation of tags and would have made annotation too dependent
on the interpretation of the text (e.g. we sometimes cannot be sure whether a
character is hallucinating/dreaming or not). Instead, according to our guidelines,
annotators need only indicate whether the world depicted in the narration of a lower
level is factually dependent on the world depicted in the higher level or not (see
Change of narrated worlds below). We also agreed that it would be helpful to annotate whether a narrative on a lower level is embedded in, or framed by, the
narrative of the higher level. (For the theoretical background see Embedding vs
framing narrative below.) The problem was, again, one of drawing a clear line
between framing and embedding. For example, when the narrated passage on the
lower level is just as long as the narrated passage on the higher level, is the former
142

J O U R N A L O F C U LT U R A L A N A LY T I C S

embedded in, or framed by, the latter?
Hence, in our systematization of narrative levels we focused on the features that
define narratives within narratives: the narrator (position) (see Narrator’s position and part in the narrative (Genette)), the narratee (see Narratee (Nelles)) and
the (in)dependence of the narrated world (see Change of narrated worlds). We
furthermore determined whether or not the narrative within a narrative is (quantitatively) the main narrative of the whole text and if it is fully enclosed (see
Embedding vs framing narrative and Opened vs closed narratives). Last but not
least, we took into account if the boundary between narrative levels is strictly
observed or if there are cases in which, although we may notice a separate level of
narration in some respects, the boundary is transcended in others (see The nature
of the boundary between the levels (Füredy)).
A question that came up time and again during our discussions was which aspects
our guidelines should cover in the first place. We might try to only annotate features that can be identified without much prior interpretation, but this would mean
to exclude exactly those issues that make literary analysis so intriguing. The students also wondered whether it is possible to develop guidelines that can be used
for all literary texts. When we annotated the short texts provided by the organisers of SANTA, we soon realised that some of the phenomena that we included
in our guidelines were not to be found in these texts, whereas some features that
we identified in the texts were not covered by our guidelines. Hence, developing
guidelines that are too specifically tailored to one text or genre will make the guidelines useless for analysing other texts, but when the guidelines are too general, they
tend not to yield interesting results.
During our in-class discussions, it became clear to what extent annotation depends
on definitions and interpretations. Students pointed out that, in the future, they
would never rely on studies based on corpora without first considering the guide-

143

C O L L A B O R AT I V E A N N O TAT I O N A S A T E A C H I N G T O O L

lines that were used to annotate them. Even though many of them were critical as
to the applicability of annotation for their purposes as literary scholars, they appreciated the development and use of annotation guidelines as a tool for close reading:
rather than let an ambiguous text stay ambiguous, they simply had to decide for
one option in order to be able to annotate a passage and had to justify their choice
with reference to the whole text or to adapt the guidelines in order to address and
document the ambiguity. Likewise, they had to precisely identify the location of
changes (e.g. of level or narratee) in the text. Students also liked the idea of creating guidelines that were to be used by others as it provided a welcome contrast to
writing term papers that no one but their lecturer would read. However, they would
have appreciated to get the guidelines and annotated texts of all other participants
and to receive feedback on their own guidelines (either by the organisers or by the
participants who used them to annotate).
The biggest problem was that it was not really clear which research question the
guidelines were designed to tackle. Depending on this, we could have shifted the
focus of our guidelines by adding or omitting certain categories. Overall, our students enjoyed the SANTA competition because it enabled them to practice their
close reading skills as well as to learn and critically evaluate a new method of
conducting literary studies.

Change of narrative levels (Genette)
Theoretical Explanation
Change of narrative levels

A threshold between one narrative level and another: according to Genette, strictly
speaking, only a second narrative (metadiegetic level) within the first one (the
intradiegetic one).3

Definition of the three possible narrative levels:
1. Level within the global text at which the telling of the narrator-characters’
story occurs
2. Level at which the primary narrator’s discourse occurs
3. Level outside of the narrative act situated outside the primary narrator’s discourse
Change of narrator

1. an actual change of narrator
an actual change of narrator (one of the narrated characters tells a story etc.);

When annotating narrative_level, please also include the punctuation marks that
appear immediately before and after the first and last words occurring in this level
(e.g. quotation marks or full stops) in your annotation.
When annotating level_change and narrator_change, please locate the tag between the two passages that differ in level or narrator.

What Does Not Belong Here?
Distinction between homodiegetic, heterodiegetic, and autodiegetic narrator. (For
this, see below.)

Frequent Markers & Test
level_change and narrative_level: It is the overall goal of our guidelines to identify changes of narrative levels. Hence, all criteria discussed here and below (change
of narrator, change of narratee, or change of the narrated world) can be indicators
of a level change. A change in time can also be an indicator.
narrator_change: Often, the change of narrator is signaled in the text itself. E.g.
“And then he began to tell his story…” or “In her letter she wrote the following…”
146

J O U R N A L O F C U LT U R A L A N A LY T I C S

The change of the position of the narrator with respect to the story or the change
of the participation of the narrator in the story can also be indicators (see below,
Narrator’s position and part in the narrative (Genette)).

Examples
(1) LEVEL CHANGE:
</level_change value=no > So strange an accident has happened to us, that I cannot
forbear recording it, although it is very probable that you will see me before these papers
can come to your possession.
[. . . ]
</level_change value = yes > It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the
original æra of my being: all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct.

(2) NARRATIVE LEVELS:
<narrative_level number =2 > This manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest
pleasure: but to me, who know him, and who hear it from his own lips, with what interest
and sympathy shall I read it in some future day! </narrative level>
<narrative_level number = 1a > I am by birth a Genevese; and my family is one of
the most distinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years’
counsellors and syndics; and my father had filled several public situations with honour
and reputation. </narrative_level> <narrative_level number = 1b > I lay on
my straw, but I could not sleep. I thought of the occurrences of the day. What chiefly
struck me was the gentle manners of these people; and I longed to join them, but dared
not. </narrative_level>

(3) NARRATOR CHANGE:
</narrator_change value= yes > It is with considerable difficulty that I remember
the original æra of my being: all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct.
</narrator_change value=”no”> Nothing is more painful to the human mind, than,
after the feelings have been worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness
of inaction and certainty which follows, and deprives the soul both of hope and fear.

Narrator’s Position and Part in the Narrative (Genette)
Theoretical Explanation
1. The narrator is either part of the narration or not, i.e. s/he is:5
(a) Heterodiegetic narrator: the narrator is not part of the actual narration
(b) Homodiegetic narrator: the narrator is part of the actual narration
i. Autodiegetic narrator (special case of 1.(b)): the narrator is part
of the narration and is also the protagonist of the story
2. Narrators can also be identified according to their position with respect to
the narrative levels:6
(a) Extradiegetic narrator: extradiegetic narrative level = level at which intradiegetic events are described; literary act. An extradiegetic narrator
does not appear as narrator within a diegesis.
(b) Intradiegetic narrator: intradiegetic events are described within the
first level of the narrative. There is also an intradiegetic narrator: s/he
is already a character in a narrative that is not his/her own

Frequent Markers & Test
Pronouns are a good indicator for determining whether a narrator is heterodiegetic
or homodiegetic. The presence of homodiegetic and autodiegetic narrators is often
explicitly marked; they are usually overt narrators. Heterodiegetic narrators are
often (but not always) covert narrators.

Example
(4) (Beginning of Chapter 7 of Frankenstein)
<narrator participation "homodiegetic narrator"> On my return, I found the
following letter from my father: </narrator>
< narrator position "intradiegetic narrator"> “My dear Victor, “You have
probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of your return to us; and I was at
first tempted to write only a few lines, merely mentioning the day on which I should
expect you. But that would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it. What would be your
surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to behold, on the
contrary, tears and wretchedness? </narrator>

Narratee (Nelles)
Theoretical Explanation
We have included this category since sometimes narrative levels are only to be
distinguished by a change of narratee. In other words, the narrator may remain the
same, and the narrated world (see Change of narrated worlds below) may remain
the same, but the person to whom the story is told may become a different one.
(E.g. when the autodiegetic narrator of the first-level narrative tells a story to a
specific person within that narrative.)7
There are two possibilities:

150

The tag occurs at the point between two passages that are told to two different

my best friend sent me. <change_narratee=”yes”> “Dear Mary, you will not
believe what happened to me. [. . . ]”

Borders
The tag occurs at the point between two passages that are told to two different
narratees, i.e. it annotates the blank between text rather than the text itself.

What Does Not Belong Here?
Different narratees that only differ in that they are different persons on the same
narrative level, in the same time, in the same world, etc. are not annotated as
“changed narratees”. E.g. when an autodiegetic narrator directly addresses different ‘readers’ and says “You, Sir, will probably not believe my story, but you,
Madam, will certainly trust me when I say [. . . ]”, ‘Sir’ and ‘Madam are not counted
as different narratees.
151

C O L L A B O R AT I V E A N N O TAT I O N A S A T E A C H I N G T O O L

Frequent Markers & Test
A change in narratee is usually signaled by mentioning the name of the new narratee or by any other expression that makes clear who the embedded narrative is
directed at.

Change of narrated worlds
Theoretical Explanation
We have included this category since it is a key to providing significant information
about the relation of the different narratives to each other: do they depend on each
other or are they fictions within fictions? Just as fictional texts are counterfactually
independent of the actual world8 , second-level narratives may be counterfactually
independent of the world of the first-level narrative. Examples are inserted narratives (as in the Decamerone or the Canterbury Tales).
Ryan describes in her theory the crossing of boundaries, either illocutionary or
ontological. An ontological crossing of boundaries refers to a change of reality.
These kinds of reality shifts affect the narratological structure and are therefore
important for our guidelines. A shift of reality occurs when narratives refer to two
different worlds that are not dependent on each other.
Our category of narrated worlds is similar but not identical with Ryan’s “ontological boundary”,9 which is, however, not strictly logical and therefore impracticable.
In the case of narrated dreams it may sometimes be difficult to decide if there is a
change of worlds, but even though in dream worlds different physical laws might
apply, the dream world is dependent on the narrative world, either due to influence
of the experiences of the dreamer or due to their prophetic character. This is why
we recommend tagging dreams, as a rule, as “same world”.

Frequent Markers Test
To test whether an embedded narrative is counterfactually dependent or independent of its frame narrative, one can simply ask: “If aspect X changed in the reality
of the frame narrative, would aspect X also have to change in the embedded narrative?” For example, a strange fairy tale in an embedded narrative is a change in
reality (i.e. counterfactually independent of the ‘real world’ depicted in the frame
narrative) because it does not have to adhere to the rules of the reality of the frame
narrative. (E.g. in the frame narrative gravity exists and elephants cannot talk but
in the embedded narrative gravity does not exist and elephants can talk.)

The nature of the level-change structure:
Embedding vs framing narrative
Theoretical Explanation
1. Description of the theory: the initial idea of using this tag to mark a levelchange is framing of embedding. Embedding can be thought of as inserting
or placing something within a larger unit, thus the main story is the embedding one. Framing is generally regarded as a presentational technique: the
frame tale is of limited length and varying significance, serving to render the
ampler inset or inner tale (Binnenerzählung) accessible and/or to authenticate it, imbuing it with a “narratorial illusionism”10 , particularly in simulations of oral storytelling,11 in which case the main story is the embedded
one. However, there is no strict definition distinguishing how large a lower
story should be when it is called the embedding story, and similarly, how
long a higher level should be when the lower level is called a framing story.
Besides, if one identifies framing or embedding by finding which level the
main story belongs to, the result could depend largely on interpretation.
Here, we provide an alternative by giving the number of words in each level
154

J O U R N A L O F C U LT U R A L A N A LY T I C S

which can be used to compare the length of levels without using the ambiguous term “framing” and “embedding”.
2. whenever there is a level change in the text, which should be tagged following the instruction in “Change of narrative levels (Genette)”, read the
following guidelines to add the information of level length.
When counting the words of “level n”, first count the number of words “Ln”
between the tag <narrative_level number=”n”> and the first end of tag
</narrative_level number=”n”> after it (so that you do not count any
other parallel level n that does not belong to the same narrative).
If there is no “level n+1” within “level n”, L=Ln.
If there is “level n+1” within “level n”, count the number of words “Lma”,
“Lmb”, “Lmc”, etc. between each pair of beginning tag <narrative_level
number=”n+1”> and the corresponding end tag </narrative_level number=”n+1”>
respectively. Lm=Lma+Lmb+Lmc… L=Ln-Lm
Put the tag </narrative_level words=”L”> after the corresponding level
tag <narrative_level number=”n”>

The nature of the boundary between the levels (Füredy)
Theoretical Explanation
This category is optional and should only be applied if there is at least one metalepsis that can be clearly identified in a text.12
Strictly observed

Strict boundary between narrative levels. (<boundary transgression="no">)
EXPLANATION: This category is applied when the boundary between narrative
levels is respected. Strictly put: it is applied when a metalepsis does not occur and
therefore cannot be applied.

159

C O L L A B O R AT I V E A N N O TAT I O N A S A T E A C H I N G T O O L

Metalepsis

EXPLANATION: a metalepsis is identified according to Genette’s terminology.13
Therefore, this category is only applied in instances were a transition between narrative levels can be identified and only if the following condition is fulfilled: any
intrusion by a narrator or narratee from outside of the particular narrative level that
transgresses its internal logic. This can occur when authors (or their readers) introduce themselves into the fictive action of the narrative, or when a character in a
narrative intrudes into the narrative level of the author (or reader). Such intrusions
disturb the distinction between levels.
Pseudo-diegetic narration

cf. Genette: second-level narrative told as first-level narrative14
“a narrative second in origin but which, lacking a diegetic relay, is narrated as
though it were diegetic”.15 This often means that we do not know who exactly is
narrating in a passage.
