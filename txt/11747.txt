Preliminary Remarks
These guidelines were developed in our seminar “Digital Methods in Literary
Studies”, which was aimed at M.A. students and advanced B.A. students.1 At the
beginning of the seminar, students were introduced to the aims and challenges of
digital annotating in general as well as to different narratological theories (including Genette, Ryan, Nelles, and Füredy). Due to its narratologically challenging
nature, Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein was chosen as a text against which we could
test our guidelines and which triggered their modification. In Frankenstein many
changes (e.g. of narrator and narratee) occur at the beginning of chapters. Even
though such changes can, of course, also be found in the middle of chapters, annotators should pay special attention to the beginning of chapters, because they
often coincide with a change in narrator, narratee, or narrated world.

One problem we debated in class was how to annotate in the first place: Should
we only annotate the place in which the change occurs, e.g. the point between two
different narrative levels, or should we annotate the whole passage belonging on
one level? In the end, we decided to use a combined model, i.e. to allow both the
use of paired brackets and the annotation of the point in-between two contrasting
passages.
The in-class discussions soon drew our attention to fundamental problems that
arise when trying to transform vague or even contradictory narratological theories into unambiguous, widely applicable annotation categories. The first issue
was the definition of narrative itself. In particular, when does a dialogue, which
is part of a narrative, become a narrative of its own? For example, is the statement
“I went to the supermarket and bought some fruit” already a narrative? As a simple working definition we decided to chose “a report of connected events.”2 This
is important because, for example, Ryan has an even wider definition,3 which
leads, as we think, to obscuring matters by a proliferation of narratives. The example, however, indicates a wider problem: there needs to be a clearly defined
research question before starting to define and annotate narrative levels. For example, when one wants to find out whether novels from the eighteenth century
tend to have more embedded narratives than twentieth-century novels, using annotation guidelines that are primarily based on Ryan’s theory (see 1 and 4 below)
might distort one’s results because the crossing of an illocutionary or an ontological boundary does not necessarily establish an embedded narrative. Hence, even
within the field of embedded narrative, there is no such thing as a ‘universally
marked-up text’ that has to be annotated once and then can be re-used for many
different research purposes.
The discussion of Frankenstein alerted us to another problem, namely the question of who, actually, is the narrator in a given passage: In the novel, Walton
does not hear the Creature relate its own story; instead, it is filtered through
Frankenstein. Who, then, is the narrator of the passages concerning the early
life of the Creature? The Creature who related them to Victor, Victor who tells
them to Walton (and maybe slightly manipulates them), or Walton who writes
them down (and maybe does not transcribe Victor’s tale verbatim)? For the sake
of simplicity, we decided to go for the original source and assumed that the Creature is the most relevant narrator of its own tale. We also suggest to consider
mediated documents (e.g. letters that are transcribed or read aloud by characters) as embedded narratives. The aspect of time (e.g. whether a certain part of

the narrative occurs in a prolepsis) also had to be discarded since otherwise our
guidelines would have become too complex. Furthermore, when contemplating
how to annotate two narrative levels that describe different worlds, we decided
not to use separate tags for dreams, beliefs, delusions, and the like. This would
have led to a proliferation of tags and would have made annotation too dependent on the interpretation of the text (e.g. we sometimes cannot be sure whether
a character is hallucinating/dreaming or not). Instead, according to our guidelines, annotators need only indicate whether the world depicted in the narration
of a lower level is factually dependent on the world depicted in the higher level
or not (see 4 below). We also agreed that it would be helpful to annotate whether
a narrative on a lower level is embedded in, or framed by, the narrative of the
higher level. (For the theoretical background see 5.1 below.) The problem was,
again, one of drawing a clear line between framing and embedding. For example, when the narrated passage on the lower level is just as long as the narrated
passage on the higher level, is the former embedded in, or framed by, the latter?
Hence, in our systematization of narrative levels we focused on the features that
define narratives within narratives: the narrator (position) (see 2), the narratee
(see 3) and the (in)dependence of the narrated world (see 4). We furthermore
determined whether the narrative within a narrative is (quantitatively) the main
narrative of the whole text or not and if its is fully enclosed (see 5). Last but not
least, we took into account if the boundary between narrative levels is strictly
observed or if there are cases in which, although we may notice a separate level
of narration in some respects, the boundary is transcended in others (see 6).
A question that came up time and again during our discussions was which aspects
our guidelines should cover in the first place. We might try to only annotate
features that can be identified without much prior interpretation but this would
mean to exclude exactly those issues that make literary analysis so intriguing.
The students also wondered whether it is possible to develop guidelines that can
be used for all literary texts. When we annotated the short texts provided by
the organisers of SANTA, we soon realised that some of the phenomena that
we included in our guidelines were not to be found in these texts, whereas some
features that we identified in the texts were not covered by our guidelines. Hence,
developing guidelines that are too specifically tailored to one text or genre will
make the guidelines useless for analysing other texts, but when the guidelines are
too general, they tend not to yield interesting results.
During our in-class discussions, it became clear to what extent annotation depends on definitions and interpretations. Students pointed out that, in the future, they would never rely to studies based on corpora without first considering
the guidelines that were used to annotate them. Even though many of them were
3

critical as to the applicability of annotation for their purposes as literary scholars,
they appreciated the development and use of annotation guidelines as a tool for
close reading: Rather than let an ambiguous text stay ambiguous, they simply
had to decide for one option in order to be able to annotate a passage and had
to justify their choice with reference to the whole text or to adapt the guidelines
in order to address and document the ambiguity. Likewise, they had to precisely
identify the location of changes (e.g. of level or narratee) in the text. Students also
liked the idea of creating guidelines that were to be used by others as it provided
a welcome contrast to writing term papers that no one but their lecturer would
read. However, they would have appreciated to get the guidelines and annotated
texts of all other participants and to receive feedback on their own guidelines
(either by the organisers or by the participants who used them to annotate).
The biggest problem was that it was not really clear which research question the
guidelines were designed to tackle. Depending on this, we could have shifted the
focus of our guidelines by adding or omitting certain categories. Overall, our
students enjoyed the SANTA competition because it enabled them to practice
their close reading skills as well as to learn and critically evaluate a new method
of conducting literary studies.

dead calmness of inaction and certainty which follows, and deprives the soul both
of hope and fear.

2. Narrator’s Position and Part in the Narrative (Genette)
Theoretical Explanation7
2.1 The narrator is either part of the narration or not, i.e. s/he is:
2.1.1 Heterodiegetic narrator
2.1.2 Homodiegetic narrator
2.1.2.1 Autodiegetic narrator (special case of 2.1.2)
2.2 Narrator can also be identified according to their position with respect to the
narrative levels:
2.2.1 Extradiegetic narrator
2.2.2 Intradiegetic narrator

2.3 Narrator Participation
2.3.1 Homodiegetic Narrator : The Narrator is part of the actual narration
2.3.2 Heterodiegetic Narrator: The narrator is not part of the actual narration
2.3.3 Autodiegetic Narrator: The narrator is part of the narration and is also the
protagonist of the story
2.4 Narrator Position
2.4.1 Extradiegetic Narrator: Extradiegetic narrative level = level at which intradiegetic events are described; literary act. An extradiegetic narrator does not
appear as narrator within a diegesis.
2.4.2 Intradiegetic Narrator: Intradiegetic events are described within the first
level of the narrative. There is also an intradiegetic narrator: s/he is already a
character in a narrative that is not his/her own.

”You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of your return

day on which I should expect you. But that would be a cruel kindness, and I dare
not do it. What would be your surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and
glad welcome, to behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness? </narrator>

3. Narratee (Nelles)
Theoretical Explanation8
We have included this category since sometimes narrative levels are only to be
distinguished by a change of narratee. In other words, the narrator may remain
the same, and the narrated world (see 4 below) may remain the same but the
person to whom the story is told may become a different one. (E.g. when the
autodiegetic narrator of the first-level narrative tells a story to a specific person
within that narrative.)
3.1 Change of narratee
3.2 No change of narratee

Attribute
Value

Possible Values
Yes/No

4. Change of narrated worlds
Theoretical Explanation
We have included this category since it is a key to providing significant information about the relation of the different narratives to each other: do they depend on
each other or are they fictions within fictions? Just as fictional texts are counterfactually independent of the actual world,9 second-level narratives may be counterfactually independent of the world of the first-level narrative. Examples are
inserted narratives (as in the Decamerone or the Canterbury Tales).
Ryan describes in her theory the crossing of boundaries, either illocutionary or
ontological. An ontological crossing of boundaries refers to a change of reality.
These kinds of reality shifts affect the narratological structure and are therefore
important for our guidelines. A shift of reality occurs when narratives refer to
two different worlds that are not dependent on each other.
Our category of narrated worlds is similar but not identical with Ryan’s “ontological boundary,”10 which is, however, not strictly logical and therefore impractica8 William Nelles, Frameworks:

ble. In the case of narrated dreams it may sometimes be difficult to decide if there
is a change of worlds, but even though in dream worlds different physical laws
might apply, the dream world is dependent on the narrative world, either due to
influence of the experiences of the dreamer or due to their prophetic character.
This is why we recommend tagging dreams, as a rule, as “same world”.

5. The nature of the level-change structure
5.1 Embedding vs framing narrative
Theoretical Explanation
1. Description of the theory: the initial idea of using this tag to mark a levelchange is framing of embedding. Embedding can be thought of as inserting or placing something within a larger unit, thus the main story is the
embedding one. Framing is generally regarded as a presentational technique: the frame tale is of limited length and varying significance, serving to render the ampler inset or inner tale (Binnenerzählung) accessible

and/or to authenticate it, imbuing it with a “narratorial illusionism,”11 particularly in simulations of oral storytelling,12 in which case the main story
is the embedded one. However, there is no strict definition distinguishing how large a lower should be when it is called the embedding story, and
similarly, how long a higher level should be when the lower level is called a
framing story. Besides, if one identifies framing or embedding by finding
which level the main story belongs to, the result could depend largely on
interpretation.
Here, we provide an alternative by giving the number of words in each level which
can be used to compare the length of levels without using the ambiguous term
“framing” and “embedding”.
2. Whenever there is a level change in the text, which should be tagged following the instruction in “(2) Change of narrative levels (Genette)”, read
the following guidelines to add the information of level length.
When counting the words of “level n”, first count the number of words
“Ln” between the tag <narrative_level number=“n”> and the first end of tag
</narrative_level number=“n”> after it (so that you do not count any other
parallel level n that does not belong to the same narrative).
If there is no “level n+1” within “level n”, L=Ln.
If there is “level n+1” within “level n”, count the number of words “Lma”, “Lmb”,
“Lmc”, etc. between each pair of beginning tag <narrative_level number=“n+1”>
and the its corresponding end tag </narrative_level number=“n+1”> respectively.
Lm=Lma+Lmb+Lmc… L=Ln-Lm
Put the tag </narrative_level words=“L”> after the corresponding level tag

6. The nature of the boundary between the levels
(Füredy)
Theoretical Explanation13
This category is optional and should only be applied if there is at least one metalepsis (6.2) that can be clearly identified in a text.
6.1 Strictly observed
Strict boundary between narrative levels. (<boundary transgression=“no”>)
EXPLANATION: This category is applied when the boundary between narrative
levels are respected. Strictly put: It is applied when a metalepsis (6.2) does not
occur and therefore can not be applied.
6.2 Metalepsis14
EXPLANATION: A Metalepsis is identified according to Genette’s terminology.
Therefore, this category is only applied in instances were a transition between
narrative levels can be identified and only if the following condition is fulfilled:
Any intrusion by a narrator or narratee from outside of the particular narrative
level that transgresses its internal logic. This can occur when an author (or his
reader) introduces himself into the fictive action of the narrative, or when a character in a narrative intrudes into the narrative level of the author (or reader).
Such intrusions disturb the distinction between levels.
6.3 Pseudo-diegetic narration (cf. Genette: second-level narrative told as firstlevel narrative)15

though it were diegetic”16
