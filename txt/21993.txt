ABSTRACT
This essay uses network metrics (centrality, density, clustering coefficients) to account for shifts in dedicatory practice
resulting from political crises, religious turmoil, and changes in book production practices. It constructs a network from the
names that appear in dedications of EEBO­TCP texts; names are detected using the linguistic markup from the EarlyPrint
project. The essay argues that we learn more about early modern book history by constructing networks of all the names
that appear in dedications, not just those of authors, printers, and patrons. The network includes a mixture of religious and
political figures, literary personalities, fictional characters, and bookmaking professionals, because this is the full range
of names that dedicatory practice covers in the period. By proceeding in this way, network metrics can account for a
range of dedicatory phenomena, including Queen Elizabeth’s popularity on both sides of the political aisle long after her
death and, especially, consolidation around non­contemporary names in dedicatory practice as a result of both the Civil
War and the Restoration. The imaginative networks revealed by early modern dedications are organized mainly around
untimely figures from the recent and distant past, but despite this the networks are sensitive to historical change, especially
at moments of political and social crisis.

In A Description of the Famous Kingdome of Macaria (1641), Samuel Hartlib
begins his book with a dedication to the “High and Honorable Court of Parlia­
ment,” but in the text of the dedication he saw fit to name a few people who
have little do with the Parliament of the early 1640s:

TO THE HIGH AND HONORABLE COURT OF PARLIAMENT
WHereas I am confident, that this Honorable Court will lay the Cor­
ner Stone of the worlds happinesse before the final recesse thereof,
I have adventured to cast in my widowes mite into the Tresurie,
not as an Instructer, or Counsellour, to this Honourable Assembly,
but have delivered my conceptions in a Fiction, as a more man­
nerly way, having for my pattern Sir Thomas Moore, and Sir Fran­

cis Bacon once Lord Chancellour of England; and humbly desire
that this honourable Assembly will be pleased to make use of any
thing therein contained, if it may stand within their pleasures, and
to laugh at the rest, as a solace to my minde, being enclined to doe
good to the publick. So humbly craving leave, that I may take my
leave, I rest this 25. of October 1641.1

This dedication follows the conventional form by including an elaborate header
that addresses the dedicatee, in this case Parliament. But Hartlib names two
other individuals, More and Bacon, in the body of the dedication, and he even
labels them as his “pattern” or role models in this publishing venture.
Neither More (who died in 1535) nor Bacon (who died in 1626) would show
up in a network graph focused on reconstituting the lived early modern social
world of 1641, nonetheless Hartlib mentions each of them at the book’s open­
ing. Since he is putting forth a new utopian text, it makes sense that Hartlib
would want to cite these two men as his “pattern,” making this a reference to
both the authors and their books simultaneously. Hartlib uses his dedication to
address his dedicatee but also to stake out some authorial territory by invoking
his key influences. In this essay, I take advantage of the additional names that
authors added to their dedications to create an expanded network of print re­
lationships that includes contemporary social bonds alongside historical—and
even fictional—associations. These networks show that (1) naming in dedi­
catory practice is driven as much by untimely references to political and reli­
gious figures as by contemporary authors and patrons, and (2) these references,
citations, and addresses through naming are responsive to political and social
change, e.g. when the mid­seventeenth­century political crises arrive, dedica­
tory naming shifts markedly toward untimely references. As a further illustra­
tion, Hartlib’s reference to his influences is far from the only kind of naming that
takes place in early modern dedications. Samuel Drake’s dedication of his ser­
mon Totum Hominis to Margaret Armitage also includes a number of additional
names that belong to neither the author nor the dedicatee.

TO THE TRULY VERTUOUS AND RELIGIOUS LADY, THE
LADY MARGARET ARMITAGE, Wife to Sir JOHN ARMITAGE
of Kirklees, Baronet. . . .
In my Prayers I may not forget your Two vertuous Daughters, may
Madam Margaret, and Madam Catharine deserve the stile of Jemima
and Kesia (two of Holy Jobs Daughters) for the Light of Divine
Truth in them, and the Perfume of Godliness. . . .
And, if you will be so just to your own self, as to Peruse, and still
Practise Gods Holy Precepts; so Merciful to Me, as to Pardon this
Presumption, you Crown the Hopes and Desires of MADAM, Your
Most Humbly Devoted Servant, S.D.2
Armitage’s husband, John, is included in the header, but more importantly Drake
includes his dedicatee’s two daughters, Margaret and Catherine, holding them
up as examples of piety. Margaret and her daughters are each associated with
the content of Drake’s sermon, as exemplars of the virtues (justice, mercy, and
humility) on which he preaches. Drake takes this a step farther when he insists
that Margaret and Catherine “deserve the stile of Jemima and Kesia, (two of
Holy Jobs Daughters).” In addition to the contemporary figures that are invoked
here, Drake associates Armitage’s daughters with biblical figures, further incor­
porating them into the subject of his sermon and demonstrating his knowledge
of scripture. For Drake, as for many writers of dedications, the contemporary
and the biblical exist side­by­side.
The habit of naming non­contemporary figures alongside living ones is repeated
in the texts of many early modern dedications: some of the individuals men­
tioned are living, some have died recently, others are writers, influences, and
religious figures from another time entirely. The imaginative network of a text
involves all of these figures together, and by considering them in a single net­
work, I use network metrics—density, degree, strength, betweenness—to bet­
ter understand the interlocking motivations that underlie text creation, includ­
ing patronage, social and cultural aspiration, anxieties of influence, and social

relationships. More specifically, by including names from the dedication body
rather than just its heading, this study’s networks show that early modern dedica­
tory practice is not mainly organized around present­day figures, as it is usually
described. Instead the networks are tied together by a range of figures from the
recent and distant past. And though these imaginative networks are not focused
on contemporary figures, they are nonetheless responsive to contemporary poli­
tics. Shifts in network structure and centrality measures from the 1630s through
the 1660s account for changes in dedicatory practice that arise from the political
crises of that period: the replacement of the monarchy with a republic followed
by the Protectorate, the exile of large portions of the English nobility, sudden
shifts in censorship laws and printing regulations, and ever­changing political
and religious discourses. Rather than flattening the effects of political and so­
cial change on dedicatory practice, the untimeliness of naming in dedicatory
networks alerts us to key moments of discursive shift amid political change.

Paratext, Dedications, and Naming Practices
The two examples above emphasize the untimeliness of the print networks I’ve
reconstructed: just as the landscape of reading is made up of recently published
texts and texts that first appeared long before, the landscape of print is made
up of actors who are not physically present in the social world but are nonethe­
less crucial to understanding how the relation between persons and texts was
constructed. The relationship between an author or text and a name mentioned
in a dedication is an imaginative relation. When an author does not personally
know the individual they are invoking in a dedication, or even when they do,
the appearance of that name stakes out an intellectual and imaginative space for
the idea of that person which could, but need not necessarily, fall back on any
first­hand relationship with the individual. These imaginative relations abound
during the creation of a text—we all carry the ideas of many people we may
not currently know: public figures, deceased relatives, people we would like
to meet. A dedication is one place where these imaginative relations can take
form through naming, direct reference, and allusion. By recovering these rela­
67

tions as networks, it is possible to both visualize and quantify the striking degree
to which non­contemporary names play a key role in early modern dedicatory
practice, overshadowing the role of contemporary patronage. Furthermore, dur­
ing times of political and social upheaval, dedicatory mentions of figures from
the distant past change radically, along with changes in patronage, censorship,
and other social and economic shifts that underlie early modern bookmaking.
My study of dedications comes at a moment of renewed interest in paratexts for
both book historians and digital humanities scholars. Rather than being viewed
as ancillary to the main text, paratextual material such as prefaces, tables of
contents, indices, footnotes, and addresses to the reader have been studied as
literary objects in their own right.3 Book historians over the past twenty years
have drawn on paratexts to deepen our understanding of early modern printing
and reading practices, showing that paratexts perform functions often central to
the exchange between author and reader.4 And with the availability of EEBO­
TCP and other digital resources coming at the same moment as this critical
resurgence of paratext, opportunities for digital paratextual study abound.5
In my work I often use network analysis to explore the ways in which social
relations and collaborative writing practices shape literary forms and genres.
I turn to paratext as a site of early modern relational thinking, combining my
interest in abstract social networks with an attention to material texts. Many
network projects that attempt to understand the world of early modern print use
forms of metadata—information extrinsic to the text itself like titles, subject
headings, and publication information—rather than the contents of the text or
any part of the text. In “Metadata, Surveillance, and the Tudor State,” Ruth and
Sebastian Ahnert’s network analysis of metadata from Tudor State Papers, the
authors argue that “surprisingly deep insights can be gleaned from metadata by
applying a range of easily available network analysis algorithms to a body of
metadata.”6 In fact, as the Ahnerts show, metadata has often been deployed by
governments, from the Tudor era to the present day, to surveil and abuse their
citizens.7 Metadata is a potentially powerful source of information, especially
when used as the basis for a network, and it must be handled carefully. But
68

J O U R N A L O F C U LT U R A L A N A LY T I C S

thanks to the efforts of the Ahnerts and others, there is a robust recent history of
responsible uses of early modern metadata in network visualization and analysis
projects.
In fact there are so many examples I am unlikely to have cataloged them all. The
Shakeosphere project is made from metadata: the information in the English
Short Title Catalog.8 Another network project, Six Degrees of Francis Bacon,
is derived from the metacommentary on social relationships available in the
secondary sources of the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography—not quite
a source of metadata per se, but a method that similarly deploys information
about information.9 Even projects that derive their networks from EEBO­TCP
texts directly, as I do, make use of metadata in various forms. Maciej Eder10 ‘s
study of style variation in early modern Latin relies on metadata to label and
categorize its networks’ texts even as its connections are drawn from text anal­
ysis.11 Michael Gavin12 ’s Historical Text Networks are made from a combina­
tion of EEBO­TCP metadata (specifically imprint information) and additional
information from paratexts. And paratext is precisely where my study intersects
with concerns about metadata.
Paratexts occupy a liminal position between data and metadata. As part of
the primary source, they can be considered data itself, but for the ways they
comment on and relate to the main text, they are also a form of metadata. My
project takes a specific paratextual form, the dedication, as its main source of
(meta)data, leveraging its complex relationship to the text as a source of network
information. By locating paratexts as a source of metadata, I do not intend to
reinstitute the notion that paratext is only interesting insofar as it can tell us
something about the main text. On the contrary, I hope to show that the liminal
status of paratexts allows them to make meaning independent of the “main” text
and that these meanings, taken in the aggregate, can productively complement
our understanding of the networks of composition and book production.
Given this background on the scholarship of paratext, it seems reasonable to as­
sume that the best imaginative network of a text might include names from many
69

D E D I C AT I O N S

different kinds of paratexts: prefaces, tables of contents, subscription lists, etc.
However I have chosen to focus on dedications because of their unique position
among paratexts and their distinctive relationship to the texts they accompany.
Going back to Genette’s initial taxonomy of paratext, scholars have recognized
that dedicatory epistles have a “direct (economic) social function” with respect
to a patron or dedicatee, but that because they are textually expanded beyond the
mention of a single individual, they can include many other messages, including
“information about the sources of the work, or comments on the work’s form or
meaning.”13 Genette acknowledges that while this function may seem to over­
lap with the function of prefaces and introductions, these additional messages
are an “inevitable” part of dedications. He uses examples such as Corneille’s
Cinna and Pompee to show that authors “want to justify the choice of dedicatee
by a statement relative to the work.”14 This is the same phenomenon I showed in
the above examples from Hartlib’s Macaria and Drake’s Totum Hominis. Fol­
lowing Genette, I maintain that unlike prefaces or other paratexts that comment
on a work, dedications comment on a work with a specific eye toward the so­
cial, economic, and political associations surrounding that work’s publication.
Because of the dedication’s unique role in justifying the work’s existence within
a social sphere, the names mentioned within it are particularly relevant to our
understanding of the social networks of print culture, as well as an especially
good part of the text in which to examine the political effects that I take up in
this essay.
Previous studies of dedicatory relations have implicitly acknowledged this dis­
tinctive social aspect of dedications. Dustin H. Griffin15 ’s study of patronage
and Michael Gavin16 ’s study of criticism, though they focus primarily on dedi­
cators and dedicatees, see the dedication as a locus for social information about
a text because it holds a specific—though expansive—social function. Though I
could have collected names from different kinds of paratexts, such as subscriber
lists or prefaces, the dedication is a particularly rich site for the combination of
immediate social realities with the author’s commentary on the work. And by
extending my scope to all of the names that appear in dedications, I show how

70

J O U R N A L O F C U LT U R A L A N A LY T I C S

dedicatory relations remain engaged with political and social events while not
being tied to contemporary figures alone. This is why the imaginative networks
of dedications are informative: they highlight a broad, trans­historical set of
relations among books that nonetheless remains sensitive to social change.
Even within dedications alone, naming practices vary widely. Some of the nu­
ances of the names are tied to the part of the dedication in which they appear. In
the header, where the dedicatee is addressed, names are highly formalized, often
with multiple titles for each individual. In the signature, if the author chooses
to include their name, it is often in an abbreviated or initialized form, even if
the author’s full name appears on the title page or elsewhere in the book. Both
dedicator and dedicatee names can appear in the body of the dedicatory epistle,
but usually in a simplified form. I have kept track of where particular names
appear in dedications in order to account for this nuance. And when possible I
have disambiguated names, so that a mention of “Robert, Third Earl of Essex”
in a header is recognized as the same person as “Robert Devereux” mentioned
in the same dedication’s body text.17 Knowing where a name appears in a dedi­
cation is a crucial clue to the relationship of that person to the book (particularly
it can tell us whether the name refers to an author or dedicatee), and retaining
this information allows for selecting subsets of nodes to compare networks of
dedicatees and authors alone to those with all possible names. I do this, below,
to highlight how the inclusion of names from the dedication body changes the
network.
But differences in naming practices aren’t limited to these larger name cate­
gories. One­word names for well­known figures are common, and there’s little
question about the referent of “Aquinas” or “Wycliffe.” But references simply
to “John,” though usually naming the evangelist, are more difficult to disam­
biguate (more on this in the section below on data collection). And some ref­
erences to people, like a mention of “Virgil,” may actually refer to a text or set
of texts, as a kind of citation. The “people” whose names I detect are not the
people themselves but textual traces, sometimes associated with a specific text.
The computational method for detecting names, outlined below, cannot differ­
71

I M A G I N AT I V E N E T W O R K S : T R A C I N G C O N N E C T I O N S A M O N G E A R LY M O D E R N B O O K
D E D I C AT I O N S

entiate a purely citational mention of Virgil from a more complex invocation
of the man: though we should treat the notion that there is a clear distinction
between these two categories with poststructuralist caution. In fact in these net­
works I am never dealing with actual persons but always with textual proxies for
those people. Ultimately this is a project that deploys textual evidence to take
seriously the complex relation between people and texts, and the varied naming
practices in dedications is a crucial, specialized vector for this relationship.

Textual Evidence and Data Collection
The data for this project comes from EarlyPrint, the digital project on which I’m
currently a collaborator. EarlyPrint extends the Early English Books Online–
Text Creation Partnership (EEBO­TCP) markup of a book’s features with lin­
guistic markup that makes natural language processing (NLP) tasks easier and
invites widely varied forms of analysis using the improved texts as a base. I used
the “dedication” type attribute—added by EEBO­TCP at the earliest stages of
markup—to locate the sections of the text from which I drew names. The Ear­
lyPrint corpus contains linguistic markup for 52,149 of the 60,331 texts in the
full EEBO­TCP corpus. The remaining texts are written in languages other than
English or consist largely of tables and figures that are more difficult to anno­
tate. Work at EarlyPrint is currently underway to annotate the approximately
8,000 remaining texts, but this relatively small number of texts, if they have
dedications at all, are unlikely to change the overall arc of the findings in this
project. I collected data from the text sections marked up as dedications in the
52,418 EarlyPrint texts (see tbl. 1 for more details).18
From here the traditional approach would be to run named­entity recognition
over the texts to detect personal names. But because contemporary NER tools
are designed for modern language corpora, they are unreliable for highly vari­
able early modern texts. Irregular orthography, non­standardized capitalization,
initialism, pseudonymy, and anonymity all present distinct early modern chal­
lenges to computer­assisted name recognition. For example, the default English
72

J O U R N A L O F C U LT U R A L A N A LY T I C S

model for Python NLP library spaCy, en_web_core_sm, has a precision score
of 85.43% and a recall score of 85.72% when run on modern English text.19
However, even after training the model on early modern examples, I struggled
to get precision or recall above 70%. In some cases the model also struggled to
identify proper nouns.
The EarlyPrint XML provided a different way forward. In fig. 1 you can see
the same names from Hartlib’s Macaria that I showed in the quote above, with
the word­level markup that EarlyPrint added to EEBO­TCP texts. This markup
provides lemma, part of speech, and regularized spellings for every word in a
text. The linguistic markup was provided by MorphAdorner, a Java NLP library
developed by Philip Burns and Martin Mueller specifically for historical texts,
with extensive training data and specialized code for early modern English.20
MorphAdorner’s part of speech tagging allowed me to collect proper nouns
more accurately. From there I used custom rules to eliminate proper nouns that
were not personal names and to capture parts of names that were not tagged as
proper nouns. In a review of 100 texts, this method achieved 82.74% preci­
sion and 94.84% recall, results comparable to spaCy’s performance on modern
English text.21

While collecting names, I used other parts of the dedication markup to cate­
gorize them. I kept track of where the name appeared: whether in the header,
indicating it was probably the name of the dedicatee; in the signature, indicating
it was the name of the author; or in the dedication body, indicating it could be the
name of either author, dedicatee, or some other kind of person. I also matched
names against a text’s metadata, to identify the name of the author no matter
where it appeared in the dedication. As I will show in the next section, these
categories are useful for understanding how including names from the dedica­
tion body entirely changes the network. Here is a summary of the data broken
down by decade and by type of name identified:
Table 1: Counts of texts and names by decade, from the texts in the EarlyPrint corpus. The 52,077 total is a result
of the different ways that EEBO­TCP and EarlyPrint divide a small number of texts into individual files. The
“Dedications” column indicates the number of texts that have at least one dedication (a few texts have more than
one). The “Author,” “Header,” and “Body” indicate the number of names in each category that appear in that
decade’s dedications.

The names summarized above were cleaned and disambiguated by hand using
OpenRefine. While doing this, I was also able to eliminate additional false pos­
itives where my script misidentified a place name or other word as a personal
name. Some ambiguities remain. For example, it is impossible to know whether
references to “King Charles” refer to Charles I, Charles II, or a Charles of an­
other nation. Some assumptions may be made before the accession of Charles
II in 1660, but especially after that date, given that I will show how frequently
names of dead public figures are mentioned, it is dangerous to assume that any
mention of Charles is automatically of the living king. In these cases I have done
my best to aggregate names as much as possible while remaining sensitive to
possible ambiguities.
I assembled the resulting names into a bipartite, or bimodal, network—a net­
work with two node classes where nodes of one class can connect only to nodes
of the opposite class. In this case the two node classes are names of people
and the texts in which those names appear. As Gavin22 does, I could have
represented texts as edges and left only one kind of node: people. However,
the bipartite representation allows me to consider relations among both texts
and people. This allows me to show how dedicatory practices shape both the
75

D E D I C AT I O N S

groups of names mentioned and their relationships to one another, as well as
how it both drives and reflects relationships among texts within early modern
print culture. Which is to say, modeling the data as a bipartite network allows
me to focus on the print relations intrinsic to this network rather than abstract
those relations to a set of relationships among people alone.

Results
Untimeliness and Dedicatory Mentions
The resulting full network, covering texts from the full EEBO­TCP range of
1473 to 1700, has 54,679 nodes and 113,862 edges. Of those nodes, 42,687
are unique names and 11,992 are texts with dedications in which those names
appear. As I mentioned above, a major takeaway from this study is that these
~40,000 names are not only the names of contemporary figures but the names
of people from the recent and distant past, as well as fictional or legendary fig­
ures. And further, the untimely names of historical figures account for far more
connections in the network than present­day individuals. Past studies of dedica­
tions at scale have focused on names of contemporary dedicators and dedicatees
alone, but these data will show that, from a network analysis perspective, the
most prominent names in the network refer to figures not living at the time of
publication.
This phenomenon is easiest to see when looking a discrete subset of the network—
a subgraph—for a specific period in time. Here I use the example of 1660, which
is also a crucial year for understanding how these networks change over time,
which I will cover in the next section. The 1660 network has 1,496 nodes and
1,972 edges. Of the nodes, 225 are texts and 1,271 are names. Below is a bi­
partite layout of the 1660 subgraph, with blue nodes on top representing people
and orange nodes on the bottom representing texts. Nodes are ordered left to
right by their degree, and sized by degree centrality (fig. 2). To see individual
names more clearly, fig. 3 shows a subdivision of the above with only the top

76

ten names and the top 50 texts.

Figure 3: Bipartite layout of 1660 subgraph with top 10 names and top 50 texts.

To quickly get a sense of which names are most important in the network, we
can rank them by a few basic centrality measures. In tbl. 2, I show the top twenty
names ranked by degree (or number of connections), which in this network
corresponds to the number of texts in which each name appears. I also show
strength (or weighted degree), which corresponds to the number of times each
name is mentioned, and bipartite degree centrality, the degree normalized by
the number of names in the network.

Of the names above, only a few clearly refer to contemporary figures—General
Monck, William Prynne—and only one in the top ten is contemporary—Charles
II.23 The rest are names of saints, biblical and classical figures, and past monar­
chs. Importantly for the year of the Restoration of the monarchy, names of bib­
lical kings David and Solomon appear prominently, and I will say more about
this resonance in the next section. The other names, John, Paul, Christ, Sa­
tan, Caesar, Elizabeth, and God, are some of the most frequently named figures
across the entire corpus. It should be noted that for seventeenth century re­
ligious thinkers, Christ and God are very much contemporary living figures,
but we would nonetheless put them in a different category from, say, a cur­
rently reigning monarch. These highest­frequency, non­contemporary names
also take up a disproportionate amount of the total edges in the network. This is
most clear when we look at the network’s degree distribution for names (fig. 4).
A degree distribution shows the number of nodes that have certain degree val­
ues. We can see that the degree distribution for names follows a power law,
78

with only a few nodes of very high degree, and the vast majority of nodes with
extremely low degree. This degree distribution is to be expected: it is very
common among networks dealing with people and was mostly famously used
to characterize the “small­world network.”24 Not only are the most common
names not from the present, but the frequent untimely names make up a much
larger proportion of the network’s connections than contemporary names do.
The degree distribution is also evidence that this graph exhibits preferential
attachment, in which certain highly connected nodes tend to accrue more con­
nections. And these highly connected nodes, the ones to which preferential
attachment apply, are almost all names from the past.
Of the 1,496 names in the 1660 network, only 429 refer to currently living
people, less than a third. And these 429 names only account for 523 of the
1,972 mentions recorded in the network as edges, barely over a quarter. That
doesn’t mean that these names are insignificant or inconsequential. Not only
does this list include the aforementioned Charles II, it also includes popular po­

litical and military figures like George Monck, authors like John Milton and
John Selden, and early scientists like Robert Boyle. But these contemporary
names, while important to the dedicatory networks of 1660, are far from the
full picture. The majority of the names in the network are figures from the bible
like David, Solomon, and Achitophel; names from classical antiquity such as
Cato, Socrates, and Tiberius; and (relatively) recently­deceased political and re­
ligious figures including William Laud, Oliver Cromwell, and Queen Elizabeth.
To understand just how much these names from the past affect the network, I
compare different ways of assembling the network using the parts of the printed
dedication as a guide. By limiting the network to only those names which appear
in the header or signature of the dedication, I can construct a subgraph that is
much closer to a traditional picture of a dedicator/dedicatee graph. fig. 5 shows
a visualization of that graph.

Figure 5: Bipartite layout of 1660 subgraph, showing only name mentions that appear in the header or signature
of the dedication

In some respects this graph is similar to the full 1660 graph. For instance its
density—the ratio of the number of edges to the number of all possible edges—
is almost identical, approximately 0.006 for both graphs, which is about 0.002
more dense than random graphs of the same size.25 Density tells us how con­
nected a network is, how close it is to being a complete graph, one in which
all possible edges exist. In this case, both graphs are slightly more dense than
would be expected for random graphs of their size, but neither is that much more
dense than the other, even though the graphs are different sizes. This graph is
a good deal smaller than the full 1660 graph: it has only 553 edges and 647
nodes, and of those nodes 444 are names and 203 are texts. Notice that the 444
name count in this graph is quite close to the count of total contemporary names

in 1660: 429. And the difference is more apparent when you look at the top 20
names in this graph (tbl. 3).

Some of the highest frequency non­contemporary names—Christ, God, Henry,
St. John—still show up in this list, as expected. Limiting to the header and
signature of a dedicatory epistle does not mean the network will only capture
dedicators and dedicatees; sometimes names of neither appear in these sections.
But the list has flipped from being almost entirely figures from the past, to al­
81

most entirely people from the present. Prynne, for example, moved far up the
list, even though he’s mentioned one fewer time when only counting mentions
in the header or signature. Overall, this network gives us a much clearer sense
of the present­day print networks, but it loses the texture of other references
that are equally relevant to the ways authors are presenting their books. Both
forms of the network are valuable, but having access to the many layers of non­
contemporary naming highlights the extent to which early modern authors sit­
uated their books within networks that stretch far beyond the contemporary.26
And we need not stop at categorizing the names as simply contemporary and
non­contemporary. As I’ve already suggested, the names fit into many over­
lapping categories, particularly names of figures from the past: biblical names,
classical figures, names of dead monarchs and politicians, dead authors and
artists, etc. A detailed taxonomy of names is outside of the scope of this study
but would likely be essential for any study that wishes to take up these methods
for an analysis of names outside of dedications, in the full text. As an illus­
tration of what such a taxonomy might do, and to demonstrate the significant
amount of information added by searching for names in the body of the dedi­
cation (rather than just the header or signature), I have created and labeled six
basic categories for names in the 1660 graph: living people (L), historical people
(H), religious/biblical figures (R), fictional characters (F), and unknown/unclear
(U). These categories are by necessity fuzzy and only intended to give a rough
overview of the terrain of naming.27 But by breaking down names in this way,
it is easier to see the ways that names in the body of the dedication allow us
to get a fuller picture of the untimeliness of dedicatory networks. First, tbl. 4
shows the number of names in each category and the average degree of those
names.

Most of the names in the network are early modern, but only narrowly so. Both
the historical and religious/biblical categories are quite large, and with average
degrees larger than the “living” category—which here includes persons alive
at any point during the early modern period, roughly 1500­1700. The average
degree for the religious category is much larger, because of a few names (God,
Jesus) with a disproportionately high number of mentions. And because the
living category includes the names of anyone alive at any point in the early
modern period (not just in 1660), some of the highest frequency names in this
category are from the recent past: Martin Luther, Queen Elizabeth, and King
James, to name a few. The next question to ask is where certain types of names
are coming from: whether from the header of the dedication or its body (tbl. 5).

All but a handful of historical, religious, and fictional names appear only in the
body of the dedication, as we might expect. Dedication body text is adding most
of the information about relationships to the distant past, religion, or fictional
abstractions, classes of relationships which add new valences to our understand­
ing of dedicatory practice. Simply put, the dedication was a place where these
influences and values were set out, alongside personal and economic relation­
ships to living persons. But the body of the dedication also adds to our under­
standing of how contemporary or near­contemporary names are deployed.
More names of the living and recently deceased appear in the header or signature
of the dedication, meaning that a little over two thirds of the names likely come
from authors or patrons. But that leaves a sizable number in the living or recent
category that only appear in the body. The body of the dedication adds lots of
early modern names to the network, information about connection and associ­
ation that wouldn’t be available if we looked only at authors and patrons. The
average degree of names in this category that appear in the header or signature
of a dedication is 1.29, while the average for “living” names in the body is 1.16.
These figures being so close to each other (and so close to one) indicates that
neither authors and patrons nor other individuals are disproportionately driving
this part of the network: names that appear purely in the body of the dedication
are only slightly less frequently­mentioned on average. Authors and patrons are
only telling part of the story of connection among texts.
Using these categories, we can easily construct a network that focuses exclu­
sively on more immediate relationships, acknowledging that an author’s rela­
tionship with God or with Cicero is different from a relationship to a living
monarch or more contemporary writer. A visualization of the graph of names
only from the “Living” category shows a network with fewer nodes and edges
overall (fig. 6). The nodes have been rescaled by degree, but you can see a sim­
ilar degree distribution to the other graphs. A few names received lots of men­
tions, and the rest just one or two. But the highest degree names in the graph are
markedly changed. Without religious and historical figures, the highest­degree
node is the newly restored monarch, Charles II. Previous monarchs (James,
84

J O U R N A L O F C U LT U R A L A N A LY T I C S

Charles I, Elizabeth) and prolific authors (William Prynne, Thomas Aleyn) also
make the top twenty, as does Martin Luther. Though this list emphasizes the
prominence of living figures, like Charles II and General Monck, even when fo­
cused on “real” relationships the network remains less focused on timely names
then one might expect. Even with the distant past taken out, the recent past has
a strong hold on dedicatory relations.

people who lived at any point in the early modern period, roughly 1500­1700.

There are other revealing ways of categorizing nodes and understanding their
impact on dedications. Comparisons of node­level metrics, especially central­
ity measures, show how different kinds of names play different structural roles
within the network. For example, the two lists above show both degree—the
number of texts in which a name appears—and strength—the number of times
a name appears. A ratio of these measures will show which names appear many
times in just a few texts.28

Unsurprisingly, there are a lot of names in this table that appear in just one text,
but multiple times—a figure with whom a certain author may be preoccupied.
But a few figures—Jeroboam, St. Ambrose—appear in multiple texts but still
have high strength­to­degree ratios. These names, of biblical figures and saints,
are the kind of people whose writings one might discuss at length or about whom
one might tell a story, as opposed to a person for whom a single reference may
be enough.
A different set of names can be discovered by examining ratios with between­
ness centrality—a relative measure of the number of shortest paths that pass
through a particular node in the network. Betweenness centrality, when com­
bined with degree centrality, provides a way of seeing which nodes stand be­
tween sections or communities in the network without themselves having many
connections. These “bridges” are crucial for network cohesion. tbl. 7 shows
names with high betweenness centrality and low degree centrality.

These names are much more political than the religious and biblical names from
the strength­to­degree list. Maecenas, counselor to Augustus, is at the top, along
with Roman emperor Vespasian. Medical thinkers Hippocrates and Galen also
make the list.29 The bridges in this network may be names that can be discussed
differently depending on the context—an author on one end of the political spec­
trum, a Royalist, might invoke Maecenas as an example of how well monarchy
functions, while a Republican might invoke Maecenas to make the opposite

point.
The 1660 example shows that non­contemporary names make up a vast, impor­
tant part of the dedicatory networks, which in turn emphasizes that dedications
are about a lot more than simply who the patron was. In addition to these names
being important within the context of a specific year, by tracking the network
over time we can see the way non­contemporary names are consistently de­
ployed across the period. fig. 7 is a stacked time series of the most common
names in the whole network, and their degree centrality over time in networks
grouped by five­year spans. I use bipartite degree centrality rather than raw
degree here because it is normalized to account for the different sizes of the
five­year networks.
Except for the spikes caused by sparse data in the early part of the period, the
relatively high degree centrality of these top nodes stays fairly consistent over
time. The final name in this graph, King James, spikes in 1604 when James
VI of Scotland takes the throne as James I of England. But after that, his pat­
tern follows other popular names like Moses, Solomon and Augustine—James
enters a rotation of popular names that authors use even though they are not
contemporary figures.
The same phenomenon is apparent if we look at a time series for Elizabeth I
(fig. 8). Variations on her name appear throughout the corpus, beginning as
Princess Elizabeth before her reign and hitting a high point of degree centrality
(0.08) in the 1580­85 graph. Significantly, Elizabeth’s influence does not de­
crease as much after her death as one might imagine: in the decade immediately
following her death, her degree centrality stays at about the same levels as it did
in the final years of her reign. Afterward, it expectedly drops off somewhat, but
crucially Elizabeth’s influence in the network does not shrink to nothing. Her
name seems to be invoked slightly more during periods of political transition:
during the tumultuous final years of Charles I’s reign, during the first years of
the Restoration of Charles II, and in the run up to the Glorious Revolution of
1688. As a beloved political figure from the recent past, it seems that there is a

habit of invoking Elizabeth at moments of political uncertainty. Though these
kinds of mentions aren’t as frequent as the mentions of her name during her
reign, they nonetheless speak to the ways that non­contemporary naming is an
important mode of dedicatory mention, driven as much by political and social
concerns as by economic ones. The social concerns of dedicatory practice and
the economic ones are inextricably linked—tracking dedicatory mentions over
time gives a better sense of the way these two drivers for dedicatory naming
overlap.
Names from the distant past appear with more regularity across the corpus than
contemporary figures almost as a rule. I see this as an important corrective to
the practice of using dedications to tell us only about author­patron relations. It
is now a commonplace in studies of reception to recognize that readers do not
choose only from a crop of books newly published in a given era, but from a
variety of books published before then. Reading practices are often backward­
looking, and any one person’s reading can include books published across a
long span of time.30 Likewise with dedicatory practice, while early modern
books are almost always dedicated to a living person, the names that appear
in dedications can include a range of influences, citations, and relations from
across a very wide span. A dedication—whether written before or after the main
text—works along with other paratexts to signal the reader to the book’s wide
imaginative network. The invocation of names in the dedication allows readers
to situate a book and its author within a network of influences, citations, and
90

J O U R N A L O F C U LT U R A L A N A LY T I C S

allusions, and that network is far broader than only contemporary figures.
However, these findings do not suggest a flattening effect, where the same
names are repeated over and over without differentiation. Though some very
common names don’t vary much, there is quite a lot of variation over time
even with non­contemporary names. A name like “Maecenas” or “King David”
might suddenly surface in the network at a particular time for a particular reason.
We see this with Elizabeth as well—though hers is a popular name to invoke,
there are specific moments in which her name is used more often. In the next
section I explore some of the political causes of this kind of change in dedicatory
networks over time.

Political Crisis and Change Over Time
From the evidence above we can conclude that dedicatory networks are not
bound by the relationships of the present day. On the contrary, one of the clear­
est features of these networks is the high centrality of names from the distant
past. However it would be incorrect to extend that conclusion to say that the
historical context of a dedication doesn’t matter. Even though dedicators are
invoking names from a wide swathe of history, they are doing so in response
to the economic, social, and political concerns at the moment of publication.
This is clear from Genette’s initial observation of dedicatory epistles—that they
contain a justification for the book with respect to the dedicatee, the imagined
reader, and a broader societal context. Though the networks in this study show
high centrality for names from the past, the deployment of contemporary and
historical names alike is very responsive to immediate social and political con­
cerns. As I will demonstrate in this section, the networks that span the 1630s
through the 1660s show a series of changes in network structure and name use
that track with the tumultuous political and social landscape of those decades.
In response to civil war, multiple changes in government, and shifts in the reg­
ulation of print, dedication networks show shifts in name mention that respond
to and comment on this period of political crisis.

I divided the network into five­year time spans, beginning in 1630 and ending in
1670. In testing I found this grouping to be more sensitive to changes over time
than ten­year spans and without the artificial increases in degree for individual
nodes caused by spans smaller than five years. To understand network size and
structure over time, I calculated the number of nodes and edges in each graph,
as well as the average degree for each node set, the number of components,
bipartite density, and the average of the bipartite clustering coefficients.

In addition to the raw calculations in tbl. 8, I also included comparisons for den­
sity and average clustering coefficient against the average of five random graphs
of the same size in tbl. 9. Because these metrics are dependent on network size,
they can’t be directly compared across graphs of different size. Instead it is
preferable to compare the difference between the metric and the average of the
same metrics from same­size random graphs, which is what I’ve done here.
However, before I discuss density and clustering coefficients, I want to empha­
size changes in network size over time.

Figure 9: The number of names and texts in each five­year graph.

fig. 9 shows the number of names (in red) and the number of texts (in blue) in
each graph. Notably the largest graphs are the 1650­54, 1655­59, and 1660­64
spans. This may come as a surprise to book historians, who might expect to see
a spike in the number of texts in the 1640s. The early days of the Civil War and
Republic period saw a number of sudden changes to printing regulation, which
caused an explosion in the production of cheap print, especially political tracts
and pamphlets.31 And the proportion of these texts may be overrepresented
in the EEBO­TCP corpus, as a result of the Thomason Tracts, a collection of
political pamphlets collected by George Thomason that make up a large part
93

I M A G I N AT I V E N E T W O R K S : T R A C I N G C O N N E C T I O N S A M O N G E A R LY M O D E R N B O O K
D E D I C AT I O N S

of EEBO’s corpus in the 1640s. However, there’s no evident 1640s spike in
this network. That is likely because most of the political pamphlets and other
kinds of cheap print produced in the 1640s did not have dedications. Dedica­
tions tend to appear more often in longer, more expensively­produced volumes.
This graph suggests that the number of texts with dedications stays relatively
consistent across this forty­year period.
In addition to understanding the change in size of these networks over time, I
use bipartite density and clustering coefficients to observe structural change in
the networks. Bipartite density, as in a unipartite graph, is a ratio of the total
edges in the graph to the number of all possible edges; it tells us how close the
graph is to being complete. As you can observe in tbl. 9, all of these graphs
are fairly sparse, but they are also of expected density when compared to ran­
dom preferential attachment graphs. That is to say, these networks are about
as dense as a typical graph with the same number of names and the same de­
gree distribution. A bipartite clustering coefficient is a more local measure of
density. In a unipartite network, it measures how often the neighbors of a node
are connected to one another. In a bipartite network the measure is similar: it
shows how often the second order neighbors of a node are connected to the same
node. A clustering coefficient tells you how dense the immediate area around a
single node is. Looking at the average clustering coefficient of a graph gives a
sense of how closed a network’s loops are and how closely related its nodes. In
networks with lots of disconnected components, density will register as sparse
even if some individual components are more dense; average clustering coeffi­
cient will register this local density. For both of these measures, we can chart
how different each metric is from the expected average, over time.
As I’ve already suggested, compared to average networks, the density of these
networks does not change much over time (fig. 10). They all have a fairly high
number of components, and are therefore all relatively sparse. And again, this
is typical in preferential attachment graphs—the densities are not far off from
the average for their size. There may be a slight rise in density in the late 1630s
and 1640s, but it’s difficult to see from looking at density alone. However,

Figure 10: Density of five­year networks (compared to average random networks) during the mid­17th century.

Figure 11: Average clustering coefficient of five­year networks (compared to average random networks) during
the mid­17th century.

the local density expressed by average clustering coefficient tells a different
story. Graphs have significantly higher average clustering coefficients, relative
to random graphs of the same size, in the two five­year spans of the 1640s.
What shows up as a slight difference in density is much more pronounced in
average clustering coefficient. This suggests that the graphs of the Interregnum,
at least in its early years, have tighter­knit communities, with the same sets of
names appearing together in the same texts more frequently. And while this
change takes place during and immediately after the Civil War, it doesn’t seem to
last: during the Protectorate and the Restoration, density and average clustering
coefficient return to pre­war levels.
To explain some of these structural changes, especially the increased density and
clustering coefficients of the graph during the early part of the Interregnum, I
looked at some of the most prominent names from the graphs of this period. The
table in fig. 12 shows the top 20 names by degree for each half decade, with the
95

I M A G I N AT I V E N E T W O R K S : T R A C I N G C O N N E C T I O N S A M O N G E A R LY M O D E R N B O O K
D E D I C AT I O N S

degree of the nodes in parentheses.

Figure 12: Top 20 Names by Degree in Each 5­Year Graph

Observations from these degree rank lists are consistent with assumptions we
might make based on historical facts. Names of monarchs, especially Charles
but James and Elizabeth as well, have higher rank when there is a monarch
on the throne, before 1640 and after 1660. In the 1645­49 graph, the years
directly preceding the execution of Charles I, references to “King Charles” drop
to number 8, nearly tied with “Thomas Fairax,” the leader of the Republican
forces, at number 9. The lists are sensitive to changes in leadership, which is
consistent with my findings about dedicatory practice in the previous section:
whether or not an author dedicates their text to the leader of the nation, it is likely
that leader will be mentioned at some point in the dedicatory epistle. Indeed, in
the 1655­59, the final years of the Protectorate, the title “Protector” appears in
the top 20 names at number 9, the only time it appears in any of these lists.
But in the Interregnum graphs, monarch names are not simply replaced by Re­
publican leaders. Even Fairfax and Cromwell never achieve the heights in these
networks that monarchs do in the 1630s and 1660s. Instead, the networks further
consolidate around the already prominent religious figures. Which is to say, the
96

J O U R N A L O F C U LT U R A L A N A LY T I C S

preferential attachment toward names like “St. Paul,” “St. John,” and “Moses”
becomes more pronounced. This may explain why the Interregnum graphs see
an increase in density and average clustering coefficient—references to the con­
temporary political figures fall away somewhat, and references to names of pop­
ular religious figures increase as a result. Where the split is more even before
and after the Interregnum, the 1640s and 1650s see a moment where dedicatory
practice strays even farther from the contemporary and clings to names from
the distant past. With the court dissolved and many aristocrats living in exile
during this period, such a shift makes sense. The normal social structures that
govern dedicatory practice have been upended.
Changes in other names on these lists, which do not correspond directly to
changes in leadership, suggest shifts in discourse which also stem from political
crises. References to King David are popular across the corpus, as we saw in the
previous section, but those references get more central to the graphs during and
after the Revolution. The name “David” could signify several things, including
increased quotation of and commentary on the Psalms. But it could also con­
note increasing interest in anointed kingship, taken up by both monarchy’s pro­
ponents and its detractors. Indeed, the name David appears most frequently (in
97 texts) in the five­year period leading up to Charles II’s Restoration, and the
name has its highest degree rank (third, ahead of Sts. Paul and John, Solomon,
Moses, and Charles II himself) in the five­year period immediately following
the Restoration. Likewise, while “Satan” is a common name throughout the pe­
riod, the name has a modest rank of 12th and 14th in the 1630­34 and 1635­39
ranges, respectively. But from 1640 to 1660, “Satan” doesn’t rank lower than
6th. Part of the name “Satan”’s popularity may be the consolidation around pop­
ular religious figures in the absence of political ones that I mentioned above. But
it is notable that Satan in particular rises in degree rank, as opposed to Moses,
Abraham, or Augustine. This indicates that a particular kind of religious lan­
guage, perhaps of an apocalyptic flavor, has taken hold during the period, and
it will also no doubt intrigue Milton scholars to know of Satan’s increasing cen­
trality in the years leading up to the publication of Paradise Lost.

D E D I C AT I O N S

The dedication networks of the mid­seventeenth century change in both shape—
the structure of the graph—and character—the kinds of names that are being
mentioned. Though most of the most central names are from the distant past,
the network changes in response to political events. During the Interregnum,
with the monarchy and aristocracy significantly reduced, the network further
consolidates around popular religious and biblical figures rather than attaching
to many individual Republic and Protectorate officials.32 But this shift even
further away from the contemporary still suggests a discourse of dedications
that is responsive to contemporary politics, as the increased use of names like
“David” and “Satan” suggest themes that would have been on the minds of
authors of the 1640s and 50s.
Broadening the networks of early modern dedications to include the names
within the body of the dedicatory epistle shows the importance of non­contemporary
names to an author’s framing of their work with respect to dedicatory practice.
As William St. Clair reoriented our understanding of reception by showing that
reading was centered not simply on current publication but around a library of
books from the recent and the distant past; so these networks suggest that the
imaginative worlds of early modern print, manifest in dedications, are consti­
tuted of figures from a long history and not just the patrons and politicians of
the day. And though the networks are filled with non­contemporary names,
because the dedication is a genre invested in how a work will be perceived by
its potential patron and by other readers, the networks change noticeably in re­
sponse to current events. Indeed, during the mid­seventeenth century period of
political crisis and revolution, dedicatory practice changes markedly as a result
of shifts in social structure and political discourse. In terms of dedicatory prac­
tice, the networks of the 1640s and 1650s were radically different from what
came before and after. While we could certainly see those changes in terms
of authors and patrons alone, casting a wider net for names produces networks
sensitive to discursive shifts as well as social ones.

Unfortunately, though it’s possible to know when a name in the body is the name of a dedicatee, if there is a
name in the header that is not of a dedicatee (as is true of Lord Armitage in the Drake example above), it’s difficult
to differentiate that name from the names of the dedicatee(s) that appear alongside it.
18

The markup for dedications is not infallible, but it is quite accurate. In my review of 100 random EarlyPrint
XML documents, 50 that contained dedications in my resulting dataset and 50 that did not, the dedication markup
was correct in all but 2 documents. There were only two addresses to the reader (in the same document) that
were incorrectly labeled as dedications, and just one dedication was not labeled as such. This 98% accuracy rate
suggests that my extraction of dedications by type attribute captures the vast majority of available dedications in
the EarlyPrint corpus.

Because graph­wide metrics like density are highly dependent on a graph’s size, you can’t directly compare

100

J O U R N A L O F C U LT U R A L A N A LY T I C S

density measures for two graphs of the same size. Instead, best practice is to generate random graphs of similar size,
and compare the network to the average metrics of those graphs. I’ve done that here by generated two 10­graph
samples similar in size to the full 1660 graph and the header/signature 1660 graph, respectively, using NetworkX’s
bipartite preferential attachment model.
26

Degree centrality in the headers and signatures alone is strongly but not perfectly correlated with degree
centrality in the network taken from the full dedication (r=.674). Though degree centrality in the full network is
similar to that in the header/signature only network for nodes that appear in both, there are only 444 names in the
header/signature network compared to 1271 names in the full 1660 network. Though many of these nodes are low
degree, they represent a large amount of information about naming that is added by looking at names beyond the
header and signature alone. And a few are quite high in degree: the biblical king David, for instance, has a degree
of 26 and a strength of 57 in the full 1660 graph, making his the third most frequent name overall. But his name
only appears in the body of dedications, never in the header or signature.
27

“Living people” includes anyone who lived during the early modern period, roughly 1500­1700, i.e. it includes
more than simply people alive in 1660 and encompasses both the living and what we might call the “recent past.”
“Religious/biblical” includes deity names (God, Jesus) and saints and other figures that appear in the bible (Peter,
Moses). (Phrases like “Grace of God” and “God willing” were filtered out at an earlier stage of the process.) Saints
who do not appear in the bible but were real historical people (who usually wrote texts being cited in a dedication)
appear alongside Greek and Roman philosophers and political leaders, as well as anyone who lived before ~1500,
in the “historical people” category (Augustine, Anselm, Cicero, Tertullian, etc.). “Fictional characters” includes
mythological figures (Athena, Apollo) alongside characters from literary works. Any names that could not be
identified with a reasonable degree of certainty were labeled with a U.
28

This is nearly identical to document frequency/term frequency ratios commonly used in text analysis.

29

This table includes one item, “Democracy,” which is clearly not a personal name. I eliminated the majority
of the highest frequency mistakes in name detection during hand curation, but a small number of low­frequency
names terms like this remain in the data. Eliminating the rest of these low­frequency occurrences would take a
great deal of time and wouldn’t change the overall trends in the data very much. They are infrequent, and I do not
believe that they skew the overall trends in the networks. I remain satisfied by the precision and recall scores I
cited in the last section, which are consistent with state­of­the­art named­entity recognition.

William St. Clair provides the now classic explanation of this phenomenon. See William St. Clair, The
Reading Nation in the Romantic Period (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2004).

32

This study focuses on individual personal names rather than collective names. There are dedications to Par­
liament throughout the period, and it could be useful to track how mentions of Parliament and other organizations
changes during this period. But such inquiry is outside the scope of this essay.
