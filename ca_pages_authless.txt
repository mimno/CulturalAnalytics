11192-10	11192	Cultural Analytics A the Digital Humanities 1 While the question of the status of these stories within stories as narrative levels depends on the actual definition of narrative and is thus all examples mentioned before show that narrative are a fundamental part of narratives or more precisely that narratives can be seen as being constructed entirely of narrative levels This also holds narratives where the plot is not dependent on the integration of narrative levels as in these examples The introduction of additional narrators and their narrations is a typical aspect of the of storytelling and is therefore a frequent phenomenon in narratives regardless of their function and Narrative are present in all narratives in fictional texts as much as in writing and many other text types Additionally narrative levels are not restricted to written text but can also be observed in oral storytelling as well as in moving images again both in fictional and forms Thus narrative levels are highly for all types of narrative analyses In our we focus on narrative levels in fictional texts since the concept of narrative levels was originally developed for these and they still constitute the major area of research In addition computational analysis in the context of narratives so far works best for written texts Please note The of this section provides an orientation those who are interested in the role of narrative in manual and computational analysis and literary theory as well as our approach to it The specific handling of narrative levels in the submitted guidelines and its evaluation will be discussed in 3 Annotation Guidelines and Evaluation Results A Background speaking the major aspects of narrative levels are the narrator s and the horizontal and vertical embedding The notion of narrative levels as many other concepts in narratology was introduced by Gérard Genette one of the most famous The phenomenon had already been described by others 10 but it was Genette who the term narrative level 11 In Narrative Discourse he discusses a passage in s A la du in which a character tells stories of their past loves to another character in an 10 For example by Studies in the Narrative Technique of the Novel 1962 11 Gérard Genette Figures III Paris 1972 English translation Gérard Genette Narrative Discourse An Essay in Method Ithaca N Y Cornell University Press 1980 11

13680-23	13680	A IN Conclusion We now consider why is so strong across in stark contrast to English and where distance in time correlates more closely with difference between texts The between authors across long periods was not due to a similarity in the language across those time Many of the later would have spoken the common of rather than the or of the texts they When in the dialect which combines features of and both had been mostly replaced by the and by the time of and his contemporaries those who wanted to write the clearly needed help no one had spoken the model for 44 Genre has a significant influence on the of texts works from six are usually more similar than a pair written in the same century Because works of had additional constraints compared to they also had different word for example the of made it more difficult to use the article with every noun The observed across time is likely due in part to the strength and consistency of these constraints Another likely source of similarity is the connection between genre and In the classical period different genres were generally associated with specific so wrote lyric poetry in the associated literary regardless of their own native Later especially and poets seem to have followed this model and intentionally written in older It is even possible that this similarity is caused by the fact that the later authors were in a of the language If spoke but wanted his to sound like he had to learn from earlier authors like there were no native speakers to teach the language Since he would therefore be learning specifically rather than it makes sense that his may look more similar to than a generic text There is in fact evidence from authors that entire texts by heart and prior works were seen as ways of 24
